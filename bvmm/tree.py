'''
Represents a node in a tree, and provides access to the subtree rooted there.

Each node represents a symbol in the alphabet derived from a set of input data,
and every path from the root of a tree to one of its nodes (including the root
itself) corresponds to a state of the implied Markov model. Instead of growing
or pruning the tree to alter the model it represents, nodes on the fringes of
the tree are simply activated or deactivated.

Each node maintains a count of the number of times the corresponding state
occurs in the data, along with counts for the symbols that follow those
occurrences, allowing probabilities to be computed using the tree directly.
Nodes also maintain certain statistics about their subtrees, facilitating the
traversal, growth, and pruning of the tree.

Args:
    i: the symbol this node represents.
    parent: the first node along the path from this node to the root.

'''
Creates a complete, inactive tree with uninitialised occurrence counts.

Args:
    height: the depth to which the tree should be grown (a singleton tree has a
        height of zero).
    alphabet: the set of characters that appear in the original data set.

Returns:
    The root node of the tree.

Increases, decreases, or scales the sample counts of the nodes in a tree.

    fringe: if true, strict internal nodes (whose children are all active) will
        not have their sample counts updated.
    complete: whether or not the tree should be interpreted as a complete tree,
        in which case leaves will be viewed as internal nodes, and their
        inactive children treated as leaves.
