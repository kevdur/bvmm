class Node:
    '''
    Represents a node in a tree and provides access to the subtree rooted there.

    Each node represents a symbol in the alphabet derived from a set of input
    data, and every path from the root of a tree to one of its nodes (including
    the root itself) corresponds to a state of the implied Markov model. Instead
    of growing or pruning the tree to alter the model it represents, nodes on
    the fringes of the tree are simply activated or deactivated.

    Each node maintains a count of the number of times the corresponding state
    occurs in the data, along with counts for the symbols that follow those
    occurrences, allowing probabilities to be computed using the tree directly.
    Nodes also maintain certain statistics about their subtrees, facilitating
    the traversal, growth, and pruning of the tree.

    Args:
        i: the symbol this node represents. parent: the first node along the
            path from this node to the root.

class Options:
    '''
    A simple helper class used to ferry configuration options between functions.

    Args:
        complete: whether or not the tree should be interpreted as a complete
            tree, in which case leaves will be viewed as internal nodes, and
            their inactive children treated as leaves.
        fringe: if true, strict internal nodes (whose children are all active)
            will not have their sample counts updated.
        height_step: the number of levels that should be added each time the
            tree's limits are reached and it needs to be extended with new,
            inactive nodes.
        min_skip_prob: the base probability of proposing the 'identity' move,
            which does not alter the active tree at all. The effective
            probability will be greater whenever birth or death moves are
            impossible.
