preface to 1850 edition


i do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this book  in
the first sensations of having finished it  to refer to it with the
composure which this formal heading would seem to require  my interest
in it  is so recent and strong  and my mind is so divided between
pleasure and regret  pleasure in the achievement of a long design 
regret in the separation from many companions  that i am in danger of
wearying the reader whom i love  with personal confidences  and private
emotions 

besides which  all that i could say of the story  to any purpose  i have
endeavoured to say in it 

it would concern the reader little  perhaps  to know  how sorrowfully
the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years  imaginative task  or
how an author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself
into the shadowy world  when a crowd of the creatures of his brain
are going from him for ever  yet  i have nothing else to tell  unless 
indeed  i were to confess  which might be of less moment still  that no
one can ever believe this narrative  in the reading  more than i have
believed it in the writing 

instead of looking back  therefore  i will look forward  i cannot close
this volume more agreeably to myself  than with a hopeful glance towards
the time when i shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month 
and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have
fallen on these leaves of david copperfield  and made me happy

preface to the charles dickens edition


i remarked in the original preface to this book  that i did not find it
easy to get sufficiently far away from it  in the first sensations of
having finished it  to refer to it with the composure which this formal
heading would seem to require  my interest in it was so recent and
strong  and my mind was so divided between pleasure and regret  pleasure
in the achievement of a long design  regret in the separation from many
companions  that i was in danger of wearying the reader with personal
confidences and private emotions 

besides which  all that i could have said of the story to any purpose  i
had endeavoured to say in it 

it would concern the reader little  perhaps  to know how sorrowfully the
pen is laid down at the close of a two-years  imaginative task  or how
an author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into
the shadowy world  when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going
from him for ever  yet  i had nothing else to tell  unless  indeed  i
were to confess  which might be of less moment still   that no one can
ever believe this narrative  in the reading  more than i believed it in
the writing 

so true are these avowals at the present day  that i can now only take
the reader into one confidence more  of all my books  i like this the
best  it will be easily believed that i am a fond parent to every child
of my fancy  and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as i
love them  but  like many fond parents  i have in my heart of hearts a
favourite child  and his name is

david copperfield

the personal history and experience of david copperfield the younger



chapter 1  i am born



whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life  or whether that
station will be held by anybody else  these pages must show  to begin my
life with the beginning of my life  i record that i was born  as i have
been informed and believe  on a friday  at twelve o’clock at night 
it was remarked that the clock began to strike  and i began to cry 
simultaneously 

in consideration of the day and hour of my birth  it was declared by
the nurse  and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a
lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility
of our becoming personally acquainted  first  that i was destined to be
unlucky in life  and secondly  that i was privileged to see ghosts and
spirits  both these gifts inevitably attaching  as they believed  to
all unlucky infants of either gender  born towards the small hours on a
friday night 

i need say nothing here  on the first head  because nothing can show
better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified
by the result  on the second branch of the question  i will only remark 
that unless i ran through that part of my inheritance while i was still
a baby  i have not come into it yet  but i do not at all complain of
having been kept out of this property  and if anybody else should be in
the present enjoyment of it  he is heartily welcome to keep it 

i was born with a caul  which was advertised for sale  in the
newspapers  at the low price of fifteen guineas  whether sea-going
people were short of money about that time  or were short of faith and
preferred cork jackets  i don’t know  all i know is  that there was but
one solitary bidding  and that was from an attorney connected with the
bill-broking business  who offered two pounds in cash  and the balance
in sherry  but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher
bargain  consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead
loss  for as to sherry  my poor dear mother’s own sherry was in the
market then  and ten years afterwards  the caul was put up in a raffle
down in our part of the country  to fifty members at half-a-crown a
head  the winner to spend five shillings  i was present myself  and i
remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused  at a part of
myself being disposed of in that way  the caul was won  i recollect  by
an old lady with a hand-basket  who  very reluctantly  produced from it
the stipulated five shillings  all in halfpence  and twopence halfpenny
short  as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic  to
endeavour without any effect to prove to her  it is a fact which will
be long remembered as remarkable down there  that she was never drowned 
but died triumphantly in bed  at ninety-two  i have understood that it
was  to the last  her proudest boast  that she never had been on the
water in her life  except upon a bridge  and that over her tea  to which
she was extremely partial  she  to the last  expressed her indignation
at the impiety of mariners and others  who had the presumption to go
 meandering  about the world  it was in vain to represent to her
that some conveniences  tea perhaps included  resulted from this
objectionable practice  she always returned  with greater emphasis and
with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection   let us
have no meandering  

not to meander myself  at present  i will go back to my birth 

i was born at blunderstone  in suffolk  or  there by   as they say in
scotland  i was a posthumous child  my father’s eyes had closed upon
the light of this world six months  when mine opened on it  there is
something strange to me  even now  in the reflection that he never saw
me  and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that i have
of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the
churchyard  and of the indefinable compassion i used to feel for it
lying out alone there in the dark night  when our little parlour
was warm and bright with fire and candle  and the doors of our house
were  almost cruelly  it seemed to me sometimes  bolted and locked
against it 

an aunt of my father’s  and consequently a great-aunt of mine  of whom
i shall have more to relate by and by  was the principal magnate of our
family  miss trotwood  or miss betsey  as my poor mother always called
her  when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable
personage to mention her at all  which was seldom   had been married
to a husband younger than herself  who was very handsome  except in the
sense of the homely adage   handsome is  that handsome does   for he
was strongly suspected of having beaten miss betsey  and even of having
once  on a disputed question of supplies  made some hasty but determined
arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs  window  these
evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced miss betsey to pay him
off  and effect a separation by mutual consent  he went to india with
his capital  and there  according to a wild legend in our family  he was
once seen riding on an elephant  in company with a baboon  but i think
it must have been a baboo  or a begum  anyhow  from india tidings of his
death reached home  within ten years  how they affected my aunt  nobody
knew  for immediately upon the separation  she took her maiden name
again  bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off 
established herself there as a single woman with one servant  and
was understood to live secluded  ever afterwards  in an inflexible
retirement 

my father had once been a favourite of hers  i believe  but she was
mortally affronted by his marriage  on the ground that my mother was  a
wax doll   she had never seen my mother  but she knew her to be not
yet twenty  my father and miss betsey never met again  he was double
my mother’s age when he married  and of but a delicate constitution  he
died a year afterwards  and  as i have said  six months before i came
into the world 

this was the state of matters  on the afternoon of  what i may be
excused for calling  that eventful and important friday  i can make no
claim therefore to have known  at that time  how matters stood  or to
have any remembrance  founded on the evidence of my own senses  of what
follows 

my mother was sitting by the fire  but poorly in health  and very low in
spirits  looking at it through her tears  and desponding heavily about
herself and the fatherless little stranger  who was already welcomed by
some grosses of prophetic pins  in a drawer upstairs  to a world not at
all excited on the subject of his arrival  my mother  i say  was sitting
by the fire  that bright  windy march afternoon  very timid and sad  and
very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her 
when  lifting her eyes as she dried them  to the window opposite  she
saw a strange lady coming up the garden 

my mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance  that it was
miss betsey  the setting sun was glowing on the strange lady  over the
garden-fence  and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity
of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to
nobody else 

when she reached the house  she gave another proof of her identity 
my father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any
ordinary christian  and now  instead of ringing the bell  she came and
looked in at that identical window  pressing the end of her nose against
the glass to that extent  that my poor dear mother used to say it became
perfectly flat and white in a moment 

she gave my mother such a turn  that i have always been convinced i am
indebted to miss betsey for having been born on a friday 

my mother had left her chair in her agitation  and gone behind it in
the corner  miss betsey  looking round the room  slowly and inquiringly 
began on the other side  and carried her eyes on  like a saracen’s head
in a dutch clock  until they reached my mother  then she made a frown
and a gesture to my mother  like one who was accustomed to be obeyed  to
come and open the door  my mother went 

 mrs  david copperfield  i think   said miss betsey  the emphasis
referring  perhaps  to my mother’s mourning weeds  and her condition 

 yes   said my mother  faintly 

 miss trotwood   said the visitor   you have heard of her  i dare say  

my mother answered she had had that pleasure  and she had a disagreeable
consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering
pleasure 

 now you see her   said miss betsey  my mother bent her head  and begged
her to walk in 

they went into the parlour my mother had come from  the fire in the best
room on the other side of the passage not being lighted  not having
been lighted  indeed  since my father’s funeral  and when they were both
seated  and miss betsey said nothing  my mother  after vainly trying to
restrain herself  began to cry   oh tut  tut  tut   said miss betsey  in
a hurry   don’t do that  come  come  

my mother couldn’t help it notwithstanding  so she cried until she had
had her cry out 

 take off your cap  child   said miss betsey   and let me see you  

my mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd
request  if she had any disposition to do so  therefore she did as she
was told  and did it with such nervous hands that her hair  which was
luxuriant and beautiful  fell all about her face 

 why  bless my heart   exclaimed miss betsey   you are a very baby  

my mother was  no doubt  unusually youthful in appearance even for her
years  she hung her head  as if it were her fault  poor thing  and said 
sobbing  that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow  and
would be but a childish mother if she lived  in a short pause which
ensued  she had a fancy that she felt miss betsey touch her hair  and
that with no ungentle hand  but  looking at her  in her timid hope  she
found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up  her hands
folded on one knee  and her feet upon the fender  frowning at the fire 

 in the name of heaven   said miss betsey  suddenly   why rookery  

 do you mean the house  ma’am   asked my mother 

 why rookery   said miss betsey   cookery would have been more to the
purpose  if you had had any practical ideas of life  either of you  

 the name was mr  copperfield’s choice   returned my mother   when he
bought the house  he liked to think that there were rooks about it  

the evening wind made such a disturbance just now  among some tall old
elm-trees at the bottom of the garden  that neither my mother nor miss
betsey could forbear glancing that way  as the elms bent to one another 
like giants who were whispering secrets  and after a few seconds of such
repose  fell into a violent flurry  tossing their wild arms about  as if
their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind 
some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks  nests  burdening their higher
branches  swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea 

 where are the birds   asked miss betsey 

 the     my mother had been thinking of something else 

 the rooks  what has become of them   asked miss betsey 

 there have not been any since we have lived here   said my mother   we
thought  mr  copperfield thought  it was quite a large rookery  but
the nests were very old ones  and the birds have deserted them a long
while  

 david copperfield all over   cried miss betsey   david copperfield from
head to foot  calls a house a rookery when there’s not a rook near it 
and takes the birds on trust  because he sees the nests  

 mr  copperfield   returned my mother   is dead  and if you dare to
speak unkindly of him to me   

my poor dear mother  i suppose  had some momentary intention of
committing an assault and battery upon my aunt  who could easily have
settled her with one hand  even if my mother had been in far better
training for such an encounter than she was that evening  but it passed
with the action of rising from her chair  and she sat down again very
meekly  and fainted 

when she came to herself  or when miss betsey had restored her 
whichever it was  she found the latter standing at the window  the
twilight was by this time shading down into darkness  and dimly as they
saw each other  they could not have done that without the aid of the
fire 

 well   said miss betsey  coming back to her chair  as if she had only
been taking a casual look at the prospect   and when do you expect   

 i am all in a tremble   faltered my mother   i don’t know what’s the
matter  i shall die  i am sure  

 no  no  no   said miss betsey   have some tea  

 oh dear me  dear me  do you think it will do me any good   cried my
mother in a helpless manner 

 of course it will   said miss betsey   it’s nothing but fancy  what do
you call your girl  

 i don’t know that it will be a girl  yet  ma’am   said my mother
innocently 

 bless the baby   exclaimed miss betsey  unconsciously quoting the
second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs  but
applying it to my mother instead of me   i don’t mean that  i mean your
servant-girl  

 peggotty   said my mother 

 peggotty   repeated miss betsey  with some indignation   do you mean to
say  child  that any human being has gone into a christian church 
and got herself named peggotty    it’s her surname   said my mother 
faintly   mr  copperfield called her by it  because her christian name
was the same as mine  

 here  peggotty   cried miss betsey  opening the parlour door   tea 
your mistress is a little unwell  don’t dawdle  

having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been
a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house 
and having looked out to confront the amazed peggotty coming along the
passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice  miss betsey shut
the door again  and sat down as before  with her feet on the fender  the
skirt of her dress tucked up  and her hands folded on one knee 

 you were speaking about its being a girl   said miss betsey   i have no
doubt it will be a girl  i have a presentiment that it must be a girl 
now child  from the moment of the birth of this girl   

 perhaps boy   my mother took the liberty of putting in 

 i tell you i have a presentiment that it must be a girl   returned miss
betsey   don’t contradict  from the moment of this girl’s birth  child 
i intend to be her friend  i intend to be her godmother  and i beg
you’ll call her betsey trotwood copperfield  there must be no mistakes
in life with this betsey trotwood  there must be no trifling with her
affections  poor dear  she must be well brought up  and well guarded
from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved  i
must make that my care  

there was a twitch of miss betsey’s head  after each of these sentences 
as if her own old wrongs were working within her  and she repressed any
plainer reference to them by strong constraint  so my mother suspected 
at least  as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire  too
much scared by miss betsey  too uneasy in herself  and too subdued and
bewildered altogether  to observe anything very clearly  or to know what
to say 

 and was david good to you  child   asked miss betsey  when she had been
silent for a little while  and these motions of her head had gradually
ceased   were you comfortable together  

 we were very happy   said my mother   mr  copperfield was only too good
to me  

 what  he spoilt you  i suppose   returned miss betsey 

 for being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world
again  yes  i fear he did indeed   sobbed my mother 

 well  don’t cry   said miss betsey   you were not equally matched 
child  if any two people can be equally matched  and so i asked the
question  you were an orphan  weren’t you    yes  

 and a governess  

 i was nursery-governess in a family where mr  copperfield came to
visit  mr  copperfield was very kind to me  and took a great deal of
notice of me  and paid me a good deal of attention  and at last proposed
to me  and i accepted him  and so we were married   said my mother
simply 

 ha  poor baby   mused miss betsey  with her frown still bent upon the
fire   do you know anything  

 i beg your pardon  ma’am   faltered my mother 

 about keeping house  for instance   said miss betsey 

 not much  i fear   returned my mother   not so much as i could wish 
but mr  copperfield was teaching me   

  much he knew about it himself    said miss betsey in a parenthesis 
   and i hope i should have improved  being very anxious to learn  and
he very patient to teach me  if the great misfortune of his death   my
mother broke down again here  and could get no farther 

 well  well   said miss betsey     i kept my housekeeping-book
regularly  and balanced it with mr  copperfield every night   cried my
mother in another burst of distress  and breaking down again 

 well  well   said miss betsey   don’t cry any more      and i am
sure we never had a word of difference respecting it  except when mr 
copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each
other  or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines   resumed my
mother in another burst  and breaking down again 

 you’ll make yourself ill   said miss betsey   and you know that will
not be good either for you or for my god-daughter  come  you mustn’t do
it  

this argument had some share in quieting my mother  though her
increasing indisposition had a larger one  there was an interval of
silence  only broken by miss betsey’s occasionally ejaculating  ha   as
she sat with her feet upon the fender 

 david had bought an annuity for himself with his money  i know   said
she  by and by   what did he do for you  

 mr  copperfield   said my mother  answering with some difficulty   was
so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to
me  

 how much   asked miss betsey 

 a hundred and five pounds a year   said my mother 

 he might have done worse   said my aunt 

the word was appropriate to the moment  my mother was so much worse
that peggotty  coming in with the teaboard and candles  and seeing at a
glance how ill she was   as miss betsey might have done sooner if there
had been light enough   conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all
speed  and immediately dispatched ham peggotty  her nephew  who had been
for some days past secreted in the house  unknown to my mother  as a
special messenger in case of emergency  to fetch the nurse and doctor 

those allied powers were considerably astonished  when they arrived
within a few minutes of each other  to find an unknown lady of
portentous appearance  sitting before the fire  with her bonnet tied
over her left arm  stopping her ears with jewellers  cotton  peggotty
knowing nothing about her  and my mother saying nothing about her 
she was quite a mystery in the parlour  and the fact of her having a
magazine of jewellers  cotton in her pocket  and sticking the article
in her ears in that way  did not detract from the solemnity of her
presence 

the doctor having been upstairs and come down again  and having
satisfied himself  i suppose  that there was a probability of this
unknown lady and himself having to sit there  face to face  for some
hours  laid himself out to be polite and social  he was the meekest of
his sex  the mildest of little men  he sidled in and out of a room  to
take up the less space  he walked as softly as the ghost in hamlet 
and more slowly  he carried his head on one side  partly in modest
depreciation of himself  partly in modest propitiation of everybody
else  it is nothing to say that he hadn’t a word to throw at a dog  he
couldn’t have thrown a word at a mad dog  he might have offered him one
gently  or half a one  or a fragment of one  for he spoke as slowly as
he walked  but he wouldn’t have been rude to him  and he couldn’t have
been quick with him  for any earthly consideration 

mr  chillip  looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side  and
making her a little bow  said  in allusion to the jewellers  cotton  as
he softly touched his left ear 

 some local irritation  ma’am  

 what   replied my aunt  pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork 

mr  chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness  as he told my mother
afterwards  that it was a mercy he didn’t lose his presence of mind  but
he repeated sweetly 

 some local irritation  ma’am  

 nonsense   replied my aunt  and corked herself again  at one blow 

mr  chillip could do nothing after this  but sit and look at her feebly 
as she sat and looked at the fire  until he was called upstairs again 
after some quarter of an hour’s absence  he returned 

 well   said my aunt  taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him 

 well  ma’am   returned mr  chillip   we are  we are progressing slowly 
ma’am  

 ba  a  ah   said my aunt  with a perfect shake on the contemptuous
interjection  and corked herself as before 

really  really  as mr  chillip told my mother  he was almost shocked 
speaking in a professional point of view alone  he was almost shocked 
but he sat and looked at her  notwithstanding  for nearly two hours 
as she sat looking at the fire  until he was again called out  after
another absence  he again returned 

 well   said my aunt  taking out the cotton on that side again 

 well  ma’am   returned mr  chillip   we are  we are progressing slowly 
ma’am  

 ya  a  ah   said my aunt  with such a snarl at him  that mr  chillip
absolutely could not bear it  it was really calculated to break his
spirit  he said afterwards  he preferred to go and sit upon the stairs 
in the dark and a strong draught  until he was again sent for 

ham peggotty  who went to the national school  and was a very dragon at
his catechism  and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness 
reported next day  that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour
after this  he was instantly descried by miss betsey  then walking to
and fro in a state of agitation  and pounced upon before he could make
his escape  that there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices
overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude  from the
circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on
whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest 
that  marching him constantly up and down by the collar  as if he had
been taking too much laudanum   she  at those times  shook him  rumpled
his hair  made light of his linen  stopped his ears as if she confounded
them with her own  and otherwise tousled and maltreated him  this was
in part confirmed by his aunt  who saw him at half past twelve o’clock 
soon after his release  and affirmed that he was then as red as i was 

the mild mr  chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time  if
at any time  he sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty 
and said to my aunt in his meekest manner 

 well  ma’am  i am happy to congratulate you  

 what upon   said my aunt  sharply 

mr  chillip was fluttered again  by the extreme severity of my aunt’s
manner  so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile  to
mollify her 

 mercy on the man  what’s he doing   cried my aunt  impatiently   can’t
he speak  

 be calm  my dear ma’am   said mr  chillip  in his softest accents 

 there is no longer any occasion for uneasiness  ma’am  be calm  

it has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn’t shake
him  and shake what he had to say  out of him  she only shook her own
