 no  no  go not to lethe  neither twist
        wolf’s-bane  tight-rooted  for its poisonous wine 
nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss’d
        by nightshade  ruby grape of proserpine 
                make not your rosary of yew-berries 
        nor let the beetle  nor the death-moth be
                your mournful psyche  nor the downy owl
a partner in your sorrow’s mysteries 
        for shade to shade will come too drowsily 
                and drown the wakeful anguish of the soul 

but when the melancholy fit shall fall
        sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud 
that fosters the droop-headed flowers all 
        and hides the green hill in an april shroud 
then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose 
        or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave 
                or on the wealth of globed peonies 
or if thy mistress some rich anger shows 
        emprison her soft hand  and let her rave 
                and feed deep  deep upon her peerless eyes 

she dwells with beauty  beauty that must die 
        and joy  whose hand is ever at his lips
bidding adieu  and aching pleasure nigh 
        turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips 
ay  in the very temple of delight
        veil’d melancholy has her sovran shrine 
                though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue
        can burst joy’s grape against his palate fine 
his soul shalt taste the sadness of her might 
                and be among her cloudy trophies hung
