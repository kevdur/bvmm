preface to 1850 edition


i do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this book  in
the first sensations of having finished it  to refer to it with the
composure which this formal heading would seem to require  my interest
in it  is so recent and strong  and my mind is so divided between
pleasure and regret  pleasure in the achievement of a long design 
regret in the separation from many companions  that i am in danger of
wearying the reader whom i love  with personal confidences  and private
emotions 

besides which  all that i could say of the story  to any purpose  i have
endeavoured to say in it 

it would concern the reader little  perhaps  to know  how sorrowfully
the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years  imaginative task  or
how an author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself
into the shadowy world  when a crowd of the creatures of his brain
are going from him for ever  yet  i have nothing else to tell  unless 
indeed  i were to confess  which might be of less moment still  that no
one can ever believe this narrative  in the reading  more than i have
believed it in the writing 

instead of looking back  therefore  i will look forward  i cannot close
this volume more agreeably to myself  than with a hopeful glance towards
the time when i shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month 
and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have
fallen on these leaves of david copperfield  and made me happy

preface to the charles dickens edition


i remarked in the original preface to this book  that i did not find it
easy to get sufficiently far away from it  in the first sensations of
having finished it  to refer to it with the composure which this formal
heading would seem to require  my interest in it was so recent and
strong  and my mind was so divided between pleasure and regret  pleasure
in the achievement of a long design  regret in the separation from many
companions  that i was in danger of wearying the reader with personal
confidences and private emotions 

besides which  all that i could have said of the story to any purpose  i
had endeavoured to say in it 

it would concern the reader little  perhaps  to know how sorrowfully the
pen is laid down at the close of a two-years  imaginative task  or how
an author feels as if he were dismissing some portion of himself into
the shadowy world  when a crowd of the creatures of his brain are going
from him for ever  yet  i had nothing else to tell  unless  indeed  i
were to confess  which might be of less moment still   that no one can
ever believe this narrative  in the reading  more than i believed it in
the writing 

so true are these avowals at the present day  that i can now only take
the reader into one confidence more  of all my books  i like this the
best  it will be easily believed that i am a fond parent to every child
of my fancy  and that no one can ever love that family as dearly as i
love them  but  like many fond parents  i have in my heart of hearts a
favourite child  and his name is

david copperfield

the personal history and experience of david copperfield the younger



chapter 1  i am born



whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life  or whether that
station will be held by anybody else  these pages must show  to begin my
life with the beginning of my life  i record that i was born  as i have
been informed and believe  on a friday  at twelve o’clock at night 
it was remarked that the clock began to strike  and i began to cry 
simultaneously 

in consideration of the day and hour of my birth  it was declared by
the nurse  and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a
lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility
of our becoming personally acquainted  first  that i was destined to be
unlucky in life  and secondly  that i was privileged to see ghosts and
spirits  both these gifts inevitably attaching  as they believed  to
all unlucky infants of either gender  born towards the small hours on a
friday night 

i need say nothing here  on the first head  because nothing can show
better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified
by the result  on the second branch of the question  i will only remark 
that unless i ran through that part of my inheritance while i was still
a baby  i have not come into it yet  but i do not at all complain of
having been kept out of this property  and if anybody else should be in
the present enjoyment of it  he is heartily welcome to keep it 

i was born with a caul  which was advertised for sale  in the
newspapers  at the low price of fifteen guineas  whether sea-going
people were short of money about that time  or were short of faith and
preferred cork jackets  i don’t know  all i know is  that there was but
one solitary bidding  and that was from an attorney connected with the
bill-broking business  who offered two pounds in cash  and the balance
in sherry  but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher
bargain  consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead
loss  for as to sherry  my poor dear mother’s own sherry was in the
market then  and ten years afterwards  the caul was put up in a raffle
down in our part of the country  to fifty members at half-a-crown a
head  the winner to spend five shillings  i was present myself  and i
remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused  at a part of
myself being disposed of in that way  the caul was won  i recollect  by
an old lady with a hand-basket  who  very reluctantly  produced from it
the stipulated five shillings  all in halfpence  and twopence halfpenny
short  as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic  to
endeavour without any effect to prove to her  it is a fact which will
be long remembered as remarkable down there  that she was never drowned 
but died triumphantly in bed  at ninety-two  i have understood that it
was  to the last  her proudest boast  that she never had been on the
water in her life  except upon a bridge  and that over her tea  to which
she was extremely partial  she  to the last  expressed her indignation
at the impiety of mariners and others  who had the presumption to go
 meandering  about the world  it was in vain to represent to her
that some conveniences  tea perhaps included  resulted from this
objectionable practice  she always returned  with greater emphasis and
with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection   let us
have no meandering  

not to meander myself  at present  i will go back to my birth 

i was born at blunderstone  in suffolk  or  there by   as they say in
scotland  i was a posthumous child  my father’s eyes had closed upon
the light of this world six months  when mine opened on it  there is
something strange to me  even now  in the reflection that he never saw
me  and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that i have
of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the
churchyard  and of the indefinable compassion i used to feel for it
lying out alone there in the dark night  when our little parlour
was warm and bright with fire and candle  and the doors of our house
were  almost cruelly  it seemed to me sometimes  bolted and locked
against it 

an aunt of my father’s  and consequently a great-aunt of mine  of whom
i shall have more to relate by and by  was the principal magnate of our
family  miss trotwood  or miss betsey  as my poor mother always called
her  when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable
personage to mention her at all  which was seldom   had been married
to a husband younger than herself  who was very handsome  except in the
sense of the homely adage   handsome is  that handsome does   for he
was strongly suspected of having beaten miss betsey  and even of having
once  on a disputed question of supplies  made some hasty but determined
arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs  window  these
evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced miss betsey to pay him
off  and effect a separation by mutual consent  he went to india with
his capital  and there  according to a wild legend in our family  he was
once seen riding on an elephant  in company with a baboon  but i think
it must have been a baboo  or a begum  anyhow  from india tidings of his
death reached home  within ten years  how they affected my aunt  nobody
knew  for immediately upon the separation  she took her maiden name
again  bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off 
established herself there as a single woman with one servant  and
was understood to live secluded  ever afterwards  in an inflexible
retirement 

my father had once been a favourite of hers  i believe  but she was
mortally affronted by his marriage  on the ground that my mother was  a
wax doll   she had never seen my mother  but she knew her to be not
yet twenty  my father and miss betsey never met again  he was double
my mother’s age when he married  and of but a delicate constitution  he
died a year afterwards  and  as i have said  six months before i came
into the world 

this was the state of matters  on the afternoon of  what i may be
excused for calling  that eventful and important friday  i can make no
claim therefore to have known  at that time  how matters stood  or to
have any remembrance  founded on the evidence of my own senses  of what
follows 

my mother was sitting by the fire  but poorly in health  and very low in
spirits  looking at it through her tears  and desponding heavily about
herself and the fatherless little stranger  who was already welcomed by
some grosses of prophetic pins  in a drawer upstairs  to a world not at
all excited on the subject of his arrival  my mother  i say  was sitting
by the fire  that bright  windy march afternoon  very timid and sad  and
very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her 
when  lifting her eyes as she dried them  to the window opposite  she
saw a strange lady coming up the garden 

my mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance  that it was
miss betsey  the setting sun was glowing on the strange lady  over the
garden-fence  and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity
of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to
nobody else 

when she reached the house  she gave another proof of her identity 
my father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any
ordinary christian  and now  instead of ringing the bell  she came and
looked in at that identical window  pressing the end of her nose against
the glass to that extent  that my poor dear mother used to say it became
perfectly flat and white in a moment 

she gave my mother such a turn  that i have always been convinced i am
indebted to miss betsey for having been born on a friday 

my mother had left her chair in her agitation  and gone behind it in
the corner  miss betsey  looking round the room  slowly and inquiringly 
began on the other side  and carried her eyes on  like a saracen’s head
in a dutch clock  until they reached my mother  then she made a frown
and a gesture to my mother  like one who was accustomed to be obeyed  to
come and open the door  my mother went 

 mrs  david copperfield  i think   said miss betsey  the emphasis
referring  perhaps  to my mother’s mourning weeds  and her condition 

 yes   said my mother  faintly 

 miss trotwood   said the visitor   you have heard of her  i dare say  

my mother answered she had had that pleasure  and she had a disagreeable
consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering
pleasure 

 now you see her   said miss betsey  my mother bent her head  and begged
her to walk in 

they went into the parlour my mother had come from  the fire in the best
room on the other side of the passage not being lighted  not having
been lighted  indeed  since my father’s funeral  and when they were both
seated  and miss betsey said nothing  my mother  after vainly trying to
restrain herself  began to cry   oh tut  tut  tut   said miss betsey  in
a hurry   don’t do that  come  come  

my mother couldn’t help it notwithstanding  so she cried until she had
had her cry out 

 take off your cap  child   said miss betsey   and let me see you  

my mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd
request  if she had any disposition to do so  therefore she did as she
was told  and did it with such nervous hands that her hair  which was
luxuriant and beautiful  fell all about her face 

 why  bless my heart   exclaimed miss betsey   you are a very baby  

my mother was  no doubt  unusually youthful in appearance even for her
years  she hung her head  as if it were her fault  poor thing  and said 
sobbing  that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow  and
would be but a childish mother if she lived  in a short pause which
ensued  she had a fancy that she felt miss betsey touch her hair  and
that with no ungentle hand  but  looking at her  in her timid hope  she
found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up  her hands
folded on one knee  and her feet upon the fender  frowning at the fire 

 in the name of heaven   said miss betsey  suddenly   why rookery  

 do you mean the house  ma’am   asked my mother 

 why rookery   said miss betsey   cookery would have been more to the
purpose  if you had had any practical ideas of life  either of you  

 the name was mr  copperfield’s choice   returned my mother   when he
bought the house  he liked to think that there were rooks about it  

the evening wind made such a disturbance just now  among some tall old
elm-trees at the bottom of the garden  that neither my mother nor miss
betsey could forbear glancing that way  as the elms bent to one another 
like giants who were whispering secrets  and after a few seconds of such
repose  fell into a violent flurry  tossing their wild arms about  as if
their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind 
some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks  nests  burdening their higher
branches  swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea 

 where are the birds   asked miss betsey 

 the     my mother had been thinking of something else 

 the rooks  what has become of them   asked miss betsey 

 there have not been any since we have lived here   said my mother   we
thought  mr  copperfield thought  it was quite a large rookery  but
the nests were very old ones  and the birds have deserted them a long
while  

 david copperfield all over   cried miss betsey   david copperfield from
head to foot  calls a house a rookery when there’s not a rook near it 
and takes the birds on trust  because he sees the nests  

 mr  copperfield   returned my mother   is dead  and if you dare to
speak unkindly of him to me   

my poor dear mother  i suppose  had some momentary intention of
committing an assault and battery upon my aunt  who could easily have
settled her with one hand  even if my mother had been in far better
training for such an encounter than she was that evening  but it passed
with the action of rising from her chair  and she sat down again very
meekly  and fainted 

when she came to herself  or when miss betsey had restored her 
whichever it was  she found the latter standing at the window  the
twilight was by this time shading down into darkness  and dimly as they
saw each other  they could not have done that without the aid of the
fire 

 well   said miss betsey  coming back to her chair  as if she had only
been taking a casual look at the prospect   and when do you expect   

 i am all in a tremble   faltered my mother   i don’t know what’s the
matter  i shall die  i am sure  

 no  no  no   said miss betsey   have some tea  

 oh dear me  dear me  do you think it will do me any good   cried my
mother in a helpless manner 

 of course it will   said miss betsey   it’s nothing but fancy  what do
you call your girl  

 i don’t know that it will be a girl  yet  ma’am   said my mother
innocently 

 bless the baby   exclaimed miss betsey  unconsciously quoting the
second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs  but
applying it to my mother instead of me   i don’t mean that  i mean your
servant-girl  

 peggotty   said my mother 

 peggotty   repeated miss betsey  with some indignation   do you mean to
say  child  that any human being has gone into a christian church 
and got herself named peggotty    it’s her surname   said my mother 
faintly   mr  copperfield called her by it  because her christian name
was the same as mine  

 here  peggotty   cried miss betsey  opening the parlour door   tea 
your mistress is a little unwell  don’t dawdle  

having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been
a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house 
and having looked out to confront the amazed peggotty coming along the
passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice  miss betsey shut
the door again  and sat down as before  with her feet on the fender  the
skirt of her dress tucked up  and her hands folded on one knee 

 you were speaking about its being a girl   said miss betsey   i have no
doubt it will be a girl  i have a presentiment that it must be a girl 
now child  from the moment of the birth of this girl   

 perhaps boy   my mother took the liberty of putting in 

 i tell you i have a presentiment that it must be a girl   returned miss
betsey   don’t contradict  from the moment of this girl’s birth  child 
i intend to be her friend  i intend to be her godmother  and i beg
you’ll call her betsey trotwood copperfield  there must be no mistakes
in life with this betsey trotwood  there must be no trifling with her
affections  poor dear  she must be well brought up  and well guarded
from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved  i
must make that my care  

there was a twitch of miss betsey’s head  after each of these sentences 
as if her own old wrongs were working within her  and she repressed any
plainer reference to them by strong constraint  so my mother suspected 
at least  as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire  too
much scared by miss betsey  too uneasy in herself  and too subdued and
bewildered altogether  to observe anything very clearly  or to know what
to say 

 and was david good to you  child   asked miss betsey  when she had been
silent for a little while  and these motions of her head had gradually
ceased   were you comfortable together  

 we were very happy   said my mother   mr  copperfield was only too good
to me  

 what  he spoilt you  i suppose   returned miss betsey 

 for being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world
again  yes  i fear he did indeed   sobbed my mother 

 well  don’t cry   said miss betsey   you were not equally matched 
child  if any two people can be equally matched  and so i asked the
question  you were an orphan  weren’t you    yes  

 and a governess  

 i was nursery-governess in a family where mr  copperfield came to
visit  mr  copperfield was very kind to me  and took a great deal of
notice of me  and paid me a good deal of attention  and at last proposed
to me  and i accepted him  and so we were married   said my mother
simply 

 ha  poor baby   mused miss betsey  with her frown still bent upon the
fire   do you know anything  

 i beg your pardon  ma’am   faltered my mother 

 about keeping house  for instance   said miss betsey 

 not much  i fear   returned my mother   not so much as i could wish 
but mr  copperfield was teaching me   

  much he knew about it himself    said miss betsey in a parenthesis 
   and i hope i should have improved  being very anxious to learn  and
he very patient to teach me  if the great misfortune of his death   my
mother broke down again here  and could get no farther 

 well  well   said miss betsey     i kept my housekeeping-book
regularly  and balanced it with mr  copperfield every night   cried my
mother in another burst of distress  and breaking down again 

 well  well   said miss betsey   don’t cry any more      and i am
sure we never had a word of difference respecting it  except when mr 
copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each
other  or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines   resumed my
mother in another burst  and breaking down again 

 you’ll make yourself ill   said miss betsey   and you know that will
not be good either for you or for my god-daughter  come  you mustn’t do
it  

this argument had some share in quieting my mother  though her
increasing indisposition had a larger one  there was an interval of
silence  only broken by miss betsey’s occasionally ejaculating  ha   as
she sat with her feet upon the fender 

 david had bought an annuity for himself with his money  i know   said
she  by and by   what did he do for you  

 mr  copperfield   said my mother  answering with some difficulty   was
so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to
me  

 how much   asked miss betsey 

 a hundred and five pounds a year   said my mother 

 he might have done worse   said my aunt 

the word was appropriate to the moment  my mother was so much worse
that peggotty  coming in with the teaboard and candles  and seeing at a
glance how ill she was   as miss betsey might have done sooner if there
had been light enough   conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all
speed  and immediately dispatched ham peggotty  her nephew  who had been
for some days past secreted in the house  unknown to my mother  as a
special messenger in case of emergency  to fetch the nurse and doctor 

those allied powers were considerably astonished  when they arrived
within a few minutes of each other  to find an unknown lady of
portentous appearance  sitting before the fire  with her bonnet tied
over her left arm  stopping her ears with jewellers  cotton  peggotty
knowing nothing about her  and my mother saying nothing about her 
she was quite a mystery in the parlour  and the fact of her having a
magazine of jewellers  cotton in her pocket  and sticking the article
in her ears in that way  did not detract from the solemnity of her
presence 

the doctor having been upstairs and come down again  and having
satisfied himself  i suppose  that there was a probability of this
unknown lady and himself having to sit there  face to face  for some
hours  laid himself out to be polite and social  he was the meekest of
his sex  the mildest of little men  he sidled in and out of a room  to
take up the less space  he walked as softly as the ghost in hamlet 
and more slowly  he carried his head on one side  partly in modest
depreciation of himself  partly in modest propitiation of everybody
else  it is nothing to say that he hadn’t a word to throw at a dog  he
couldn’t have thrown a word at a mad dog  he might have offered him one
gently  or half a one  or a fragment of one  for he spoke as slowly as
he walked  but he wouldn’t have been rude to him  and he couldn’t have
been quick with him  for any earthly consideration 

mr  chillip  looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side  and
making her a little bow  said  in allusion to the jewellers  cotton  as
he softly touched his left ear 

 some local irritation  ma’am  

 what   replied my aunt  pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork 

mr  chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness  as he told my mother
afterwards  that it was a mercy he didn’t lose his presence of mind  but
he repeated sweetly 

 some local irritation  ma’am  

 nonsense   replied my aunt  and corked herself again  at one blow 

mr  chillip could do nothing after this  but sit and look at her feebly 
as she sat and looked at the fire  until he was called upstairs again 
after some quarter of an hour’s absence  he returned 

 well   said my aunt  taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him 

 well  ma’am   returned mr  chillip   we are  we are progressing slowly 
ma’am  

 ba  a  ah   said my aunt  with a perfect shake on the contemptuous
interjection  and corked herself as before 

really  really  as mr  chillip told my mother  he was almost shocked 
speaking in a professional point of view alone  he was almost shocked 
but he sat and looked at her  notwithstanding  for nearly two hours 
as she sat looking at the fire  until he was again called out  after
another absence  he again returned 

 well   said my aunt  taking out the cotton on that side again 

 well  ma’am   returned mr  chillip   we are  we are progressing slowly 
ma’am  

 ya  a  ah   said my aunt  with such a snarl at him  that mr  chillip
absolutely could not bear it  it was really calculated to break his
spirit  he said afterwards  he preferred to go and sit upon the stairs 
in the dark and a strong draught  until he was again sent for 

ham peggotty  who went to the national school  and was a very dragon at
his catechism  and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness 
reported next day  that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour
after this  he was instantly descried by miss betsey  then walking to
and fro in a state of agitation  and pounced upon before he could make
his escape  that there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices
overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude  from the
circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on
whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest 
that  marching him constantly up and down by the collar  as if he had
been taking too much laudanum   she  at those times  shook him  rumpled
his hair  made light of his linen  stopped his ears as if she confounded
them with her own  and otherwise tousled and maltreated him  this was
in part confirmed by his aunt  who saw him at half past twelve o’clock 
soon after his release  and affirmed that he was then as red as i was 

the mild mr  chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time  if
at any time  he sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty 
and said to my aunt in his meekest manner 

 well  ma’am  i am happy to congratulate you  

 what upon   said my aunt  sharply 

mr  chillip was fluttered again  by the extreme severity of my aunt’s
manner  so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile  to
mollify her 

 mercy on the man  what’s he doing   cried my aunt  impatiently   can’t
he speak  

 be calm  my dear ma’am   said mr  chillip  in his softest accents 

 there is no longer any occasion for uneasiness  ma’am  be calm  

it has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn’t shake
him  and shake what he had to say  out of him  she only shook her own
head at him  but in a way that made him quail 

 well  ma’am   resumed mr  chillip  as soon as he had courage   i am
happy to congratulate you  all is now over  ma’am  and well over  

during the five minutes or so that mr  chillip devoted to the delivery
of this oration  my aunt eyed him narrowly 

 how is she   said my aunt  folding her arms with her bonnet still tied
on one of them 

 well  ma’am  she will soon be quite comfortable  i hope   returned mr 
chillip   quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be 
under these melancholy domestic circumstances  there cannot be any
objection to your seeing her presently  ma’am  it may do her good  

 and she  how is she   said my aunt  sharply 

mr  chillip laid his head a little more on one side  and looked at my
aunt like an amiable bird 

 the baby   said my aunt   how is she  

 ma’am   returned mr  chillip   i apprehended you had known  it’s a
boy  

my aunt said never a word  but took her bonnet by the strings  in the
manner of a sling  aimed a blow at mr  chillip’s head with it  put it on
bent  walked out  and never came back  she vanished like a discontented
fairy  or like one of those supernatural beings  whom it was popularly
supposed i was entitled to see  and never came back any more 

no  i lay in my basket  and my mother lay in her bed  but betsey
trotwood copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows  the
tremendous region whence i had so lately travelled  and the light upon
the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such
travellers  and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he 
without whom i had never been 



chapter 2  i observe


the first objects that assume a distinct presence before me  as i look
far back  into the blank of my infancy  are my mother with her pretty
hair and youthful shape  and peggotty with no shape at all  and eyes so
dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face 
and cheeks and arms so hard and red that i wondered the birds didn’t
peck her in preference to apples 

i believe i can remember these two at a little distance apart  dwarfed
to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor  and i going
unsteadily from the one to the other  i have an impression on my mind
which i cannot distinguish from actual remembrance  of the touch of
peggotty’s forefinger as she used to hold it out to me  and of its being
roughened by needlework  like a pocket nutmeg-grater 

this may be fancy  though i think the memory of most of us can go
farther back into such times than many of us suppose  just as i believe
the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite
wonderful for its closeness and accuracy  indeed  i think that most
grown men who are remarkable in this respect  may with greater propriety
be said not to have lost the faculty  than to have acquired it  the
rather  as i generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness 
and gentleness  and capacity of being pleased  which are also an
inheritance they have preserved from their childhood 

i might have a misgiving that i am  meandering  in stopping to say this 
but that it brings me to remark that i build these conclusions  in part
upon my own experience of myself  and if it should appear from
anything i may set down in this narrative that i was a child of close
observation  or that as a man i have a strong memory of my childhood  i
undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics 

looking back  as i was saying  into the blank of my infancy  the first
objects i can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of
things  are my mother and peggotty  what else do i remember  let me see 


there comes out of the cloud  our house  not new to me  but quite
familiar  in its earliest remembrance  on the ground-floor is peggotty’s
kitchen  opening into a back yard  with a pigeon-house on a pole  in
the centre  without any pigeons in it  a great dog-kennel in a corner 
without any dog  and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me 
walking about  in a menacing and ferocious manner  there is one cock who
gets upon a post to crow  and seems to take particular notice of me as
i look at him through the kitchen window  who makes me shiver  he is so
fierce  of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after
me with their long necks stretched out when i go that way  i dream at
night  as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions 

here is a long passage  what an enormous perspective i make of
it   leading from peggotty’s kitchen to the front door  a dark
store-room opens out of it  and that is a place to be run past at
night  for i don’t know what may be among those tubs and jars and old
tea-chests  when there is nobody in there with a dimly-burning light 
letting a mouldy air come out of the door  in which there is the smell
of soap  pickles  pepper  candles  and coffee  all at one whiff  then
there are the two parlours  the parlour in which we sit of an evening 
my mother and i and peggotty  for peggotty is quite our companion  when
her work is done and we are alone  and the best parlour where we sit
on a sunday  grandly  but not so comfortably  there is something of a
doleful air about that room to me  for peggotty has told me  i don’t
know when  but apparently ages ago  about my father’s funeral  and the
company having their black cloaks put on  one sunday night my mother
reads to peggotty and me in there  how lazarus was raised up from the
dead  and i am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me
out of bed  and show me the quiet churchyard out of the bedroom window 
with the dead all lying in their graves at rest  below the solemn moon 

there is nothing half so green that i know anywhere  as the grass of
that churchyard  nothing half so shady as its trees  nothing half so
quiet as its tombstones  the sheep are feeding there  when i kneel up 
early in the morning  in my little bed in a closet within my mother’s
room  to look out at it  and i see the red light shining on the
sun-dial  and think within myself   is the sun-dial glad  i wonder  that
it can tell the time again  

here is our pew in the church  what a high-backed pew  with a window
near it  out of which our house can be seen  and is seen many times
during the morning’s service  by peggotty  who likes to make herself
as sure as she can that it’s not being robbed  or is not in flames  but
though peggotty’s eye wanders  she is much offended if mine does 
and frowns to me  as i stand upon the seat  that i am to look at the
clergyman  but i can’t always look at him  i know him without that white
thing on  and i am afraid of his wondering why i stare so  and perhaps
stopping the service to inquire  and what am i to do  it’s a dreadful
thing to gape  but i must do something  i look at my mother  but she
pretends not to see me  i look at a boy in the aisle  and he makes faces
at me  i look at the sunlight coming in at the open door through
the porch  and there i see a stray sheep  i don’t mean a sinner  but
mutton  half making up his mind to come into the church  i feel that
if i looked at him any longer  i might be tempted to say something out
loud  and what would become of me then  i look up at the monumental
tablets on the wall  and try to think of mr  bodgers late of this
parish  and what the feelings of mrs  bodgers must have been  when
affliction sore  long time mr  bodgers bore  and physicians were in
vain  i wonder whether they called in mr  chillip  and he was in vain 
and if so  how he likes to be reminded of it once a week  i look from
mr  chillip  in his sunday neckcloth  to the pulpit  and think what a
good place it would be to play in  and what a castle it would make  with
another boy coming up the stairs to attack it  and having the velvet
cushion with the tassels thrown down on his head  in time my eyes
gradually shut up  and  from seeming to hear the clergyman singing a
drowsy song in the heat  i hear nothing  until i fall off the seat with
a crash  and am taken out  more dead than alive  by peggotty 

and now i see the outside of our house  with the latticed
bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air  and the
ragged old rooks  nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom
of the front garden  now i am in the garden at the back  beyond the
yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are  a very preserve
of butterflies  as i remember it  with a high fence  and a gate and
padlock  where the fruit clusters on the trees  riper and richer than
fruit has ever been since  in any other garden  and where my
mother gathers some in a basket  while i stand by  bolting furtive
gooseberries  and trying to look unmoved  a great wind rises  and the
summer is gone in a moment  we are playing in the winter twilight 
dancing about the parlour  when my mother is out of breath and rests
herself in an elbow-chair  i watch her winding her bright curls round
her fingers  and straitening her waist  and nobody knows better than i
do that she likes to look so well  and is proud of being so pretty 

that is among my very earliest impressions  that  and a sense that we
were both a little afraid of peggotty  and submitted ourselves in most
things to her direction  were among the first opinions  if they may be
so called  that i ever derived from what i saw 

peggotty and i were sitting one night by the parlour fire  alone  i
had been reading to peggotty about crocodiles  i must have read very
perspicuously  or the poor soul must have been deeply interested  for i
remember she had a cloudy impression  after i had done  that they were
a sort of vegetable  i was tired of reading  and dead sleepy  but
having leave  as a high treat  to sit up until my mother came home from
spending the evening at a neighbour’s  i would rather have died upon
my post  of course  than have gone to bed  i had reached that stage of
sleepiness when peggotty seemed to swell and grow immensely large 
i propped my eyelids open with my two forefingers  and looked
perseveringly at her as she sat at work  at the little bit of wax-candle
she kept for her thread  how old it looked  being so wrinkled in
all directions   at the little house with a thatched roof  where the
yard-measure lived  at her work-box with a sliding lid  with a view of
st  paul’s cathedral  with a pink dome  painted on the top  at the brass
thimble on her finger  at herself  whom i thought lovely  i felt so
sleepy  that i knew if i lost sight of anything for a moment  i was
gone 

 peggotty   says i  suddenly   were you ever married  

 lord  master davy   replied peggotty   what’s put marriage in your
head  

she answered with such a start  that it quite awoke me  and then she
stopped in her work  and looked at me  with her needle drawn out to its
thread’s length 

 but were you ever married  peggotty   says i   you are a very handsome
woman  an’t you  

i thought her in a different style from my mother  certainly  but of
another school of beauty  i considered her a perfect example  there
was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour  on which my mother
had painted a nosegay  the ground-work of that stool  and peggotty’s
complexion appeared to me to be one and the same thing  the stool was
smooth  and peggotty was rough  but that made no difference 

 me handsome  davy   said peggotty   lawk  no  my dear  but what put
marriage in your head  

 i don’t know   you mustn’t marry more than one person at a time  may
you  peggotty  

 certainly not   says peggotty  with the promptest decision 

 but if you marry a person  and the person dies  why then you may marry
another person  mayn’t you  peggotty  

 you may   says peggotty   if you choose  my dear  that’s a matter of
opinion  

 but what is your opinion  peggotty   said i 

i asked her  and looked curiously at her  because she looked so
curiously at me 

 my opinion is   said peggotty  taking her eyes from me  after a little
indecision and going on with her work   that i never was married myself 
master davy  and that i don’t expect to be  that’s all i know about the
subject  

 you an’t cross  i suppose  peggotty  are you   said i  after sitting
quiet for a minute 

i really thought she was  she had been so short with me  but i was quite
mistaken  for she laid aside her work  which was a stocking of her own  
and opening her arms wide  took my curly head within them  and gave it
a good squeeze  i know it was a good squeeze  because  being very plump 
whenever she made any little exertion after she was dressed  some of the
buttons on the back of her gown flew off  and i recollect two bursting
to the opposite side of the parlour  while she was hugging me 

 now let me hear some more about the crorkindills   said peggotty  who
was not quite right in the name yet   for i an’t heard half enough  

i couldn’t quite understand why peggotty looked so queer  or why she
was so ready to go back to the crocodiles  however  we returned to those
monsters  with fresh wakefulness on my part  and we left their eggs in
the sand for the sun to hatch  and we ran away from them  and baffled
them by constantly turning  which they were unable to do quickly  on
account of their unwieldy make  and we went into the water after them 
as natives  and put sharp pieces of timber down their throats  and in
short we ran the whole crocodile gauntlet  i did  at least  but i had
my doubts of peggotty  who was thoughtfully sticking her needle into
various parts of her face and arms  all the time 

we had exhausted the crocodiles  and begun with the alligators  when
the garden-bell rang  we went out to the door  and there was my mother 
looking unusually pretty  i thought  and with her a gentleman with
beautiful black hair and whiskers  who had walked home with us from
church last sunday 

as my mother stooped down on the threshold to take me in her arms and
kiss me  the gentleman said i was a more highly privileged little fellow
than a monarch  or something like that  for my later understanding
comes  i am sensible  to my aid here 

 what does that mean   i asked him  over her shoulder 

he patted me on the head  but somehow  i didn’t like him or his deep
voice  and i was jealous that his hand should touch my mother’s in
touching me  which it did  i put it away  as well as i could 

 oh  davy   remonstrated my mother 

 dear boy   said the gentleman   i cannot wonder at his devotion  

i never saw such a beautiful colour on my mother’s face before  she
gently chid me for being rude  and  keeping me close to her shawl 
turned to thank the gentleman for taking so much trouble as to bring her
home  she put out her hand to him as she spoke  and  as he met it with
his own  she glanced  i thought  at me 

 let us say  good night   my fine boy   said the gentleman  when he had
bent his head  i saw him   over my mother’s little glove 

 good night   said i 

 come  let us be the best friends in the world   said the gentleman 
laughing   shake hands  

my right hand was in my mother’s left  so i gave him the other 

 why  that’s the wrong hand  davy   laughed the gentleman 

my mother drew my right hand forward  but i was resolved  for my former
reason  not to give it him  and i did not  i gave him the other  and he
shook it heartily  and said i was a brave fellow  and went away 

at this minute i see him turn round in the garden  and give us a last
look with his ill-omened black eyes  before the door was shut 

peggotty  who had not said a word or moved a finger  secured the
fastenings instantly  and we all went into the parlour  my mother 
contrary to her usual habit  instead of coming to the elbow-chair by the
fire  remained at the other end of the room  and sat singing to herself 
   hope you have had a pleasant evening  ma’am   said peggotty  standing
as stiff as a barrel in the centre of the room  with a candlestick in
her hand 

 much obliged to you  peggotty   returned my mother  in a cheerful
voice   i have had a very pleasant evening  

 a stranger or so makes an agreeable change   suggested peggotty 

 a very agreeable change  indeed   returned my mother 

peggotty continuing to stand motionless in the middle of the room  and
my mother resuming her singing  i fell asleep  though i was not so sound
asleep but that i could hear voices  without hearing what they said 
when i half awoke from this uncomfortable doze  i found peggotty and my
mother both in tears  and both talking 

 not such a one as this  mr  copperfield wouldn’t have liked   said
peggotty   that i say  and that i swear  

 good heavens   cried my mother   you’ll drive me mad  was ever any
poor girl so ill-used by her servants as i am  why do i do myself
the injustice of calling myself a girl  have i never been married 
peggotty  

 god knows you have  ma’am   returned peggotty   then  how can you
dare   said my mother   you know i don’t mean how can you dare 
peggotty  but how can you have the heart  to make me so uncomfortable
and say such bitter things to me  when you are well aware that i
haven’t  out of this place  a single friend to turn to  

 the more’s the reason   returned peggotty   for saying that it won’t
do  no  that it won’t do  no  no price could make it do  no    i thought
peggotty would have thrown the candlestick away  she was so emphatic
with it 

 how can you be so aggravating   said my mother  shedding more tears
than before   as to talk in such an unjust manner  how can you go on as
if it was all settled and arranged  peggotty  when i tell you over
and over again  you cruel thing  that beyond the commonest civilities
nothing has passed  you talk of admiration  what am i to do  if people
are so silly as to indulge the sentiment  is it my fault  what am i to
do  i ask you  would you wish me to shave my head and black my face  or
disfigure myself with a burn  or a scald  or something of that sort  i
dare say you would  peggotty  i dare say you’d quite enjoy it  

peggotty seemed to take this aspersion very much to heart  i thought 

 and my dear boy   cried my mother  coming to the elbow-chair in which
i was  and caressing me   my own little davy  is it to be hinted to me
that i am wanting in affection for my precious treasure  the dearest
little fellow that ever was  

 nobody never went and hinted no such a thing   said peggotty 

 you did  peggotty   returned my mother   you know you did  what else
was it possible to infer from what you said  you unkind creature 
when you know as well as i do  that on his account only last quarter i
wouldn’t buy myself a new parasol  though that old green one is frayed
the whole way up  and the fringe is perfectly mangy  you know it is 
peggotty  you can’t deny it   then  turning affectionately to me  with
her cheek against mine   am i a naughty mama to you  davy  am i a nasty 
cruel  selfish  bad mama  say i am  my child  say  yes   dear boy  and
peggotty will love you  and peggotty’s love is a great deal better than
mine  davy  i don’t love you at all  do i  

at this  we all fell a-crying together  i think i was the loudest of
the party  but i am sure we were all sincere about it  i was quite
heart-broken myself  and am afraid that in the first transports of
wounded tenderness i called peggotty a  beast   that honest creature was
in deep affliction  i remember  and must have become quite buttonless
on the occasion  for a little volley of those explosives went off 
when  after having made it up with my mother  she kneeled down by the
elbow-chair  and made it up with me 

we went to bed greatly dejected  my sobs kept waking me  for a long
time  and when one very strong sob quite hoisted me up in bed  i found
my mother sitting on the coverlet  and leaning over me  i fell asleep in
her arms  after that  and slept soundly 

whether it was the following sunday when i saw the gentleman again 
or whether there was any greater lapse of time before he reappeared 
i cannot recall  i don’t profess to be clear about dates  but there he
was  in church  and he walked home with us afterwards  he came in  too 
to look at a famous geranium we had  in the parlour-window  it did not
appear to me that he took much notice of it  but before he went he asked
my mother to give him a bit of the blossom  she begged him to choose it
for himself  but he refused to do that  i could not understand why  so
she plucked it for him  and gave it into his hand  he said he would
never  never part with it any more  and i thought he must be quite a
fool not to know that it would fall to pieces in a day or two 

peggotty began to be less with us  of an evening  than she had always
been  my mother deferred to her very much  more than usual  it occurred
to me  and we were all three excellent friends  still we were different
from what we used to be  and were not so comfortable among ourselves 
sometimes i fancied that peggotty perhaps objected to my mother’s
wearing all the pretty dresses she had in her drawers  or to her
going so often to visit at that neighbour’s  but i couldn’t  to my
satisfaction  make out how it was 

gradually  i became used to seeing the gentleman with the black
whiskers  i liked him no better than at first  and had the same uneasy
jealousy of him  but if i had any reason for it beyond a child’s
instinctive dislike  and a general idea that peggotty and i could make
much of my mother without any help  it certainly was not the reason that
i might have found if i had been older  no such thing came into my mind 
or near it  i could observe  in little pieces  as it were  but as to
making a net of a number of these pieces  and catching anybody in it 
that was  as yet  beyond me 

one autumn morning i was with my mother in the front garden  when mr 
murdstone  i knew him by that name now  came by  on horseback  he reined
up his horse to salute my mother  and said he was going to lowestoft to
see some friends who were there with a yacht  and merrily proposed to
take me on the saddle before him if i would like the ride 

the air was so clear and pleasant  and the horse seemed to like the
idea of the ride so much himself  as he stood snorting and pawing at the
garden-gate  that i had a great desire to go  so i was sent upstairs
to peggotty to be made spruce  and in the meantime mr  murdstone
dismounted  and  with his horse’s bridle drawn over his arm  walked
slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence  while my
mother walked slowly up and down on the inner to keep him company  i
recollect peggotty and i peeping out at them from my little window  i
recollect how closely they seemed to be examining the sweetbriar between
them  as they strolled along  and how  from being in a perfectly angelic
temper  peggotty turned cross in a moment  and brushed my hair the wrong
way  excessively hard 

mr  murdstone and i were soon off  and trotting along on the green turf
by the side of the road  he held me quite easily with one arm  and i
don’t think i was restless usually  but i could not make up my mind to
sit in front of him without turning my head sometimes  and looking up in
his face  he had that kind of shallow black eye  i want a better word to
express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into  which  when
it is abstracted  seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured 
for a moment at a time  by a cast  several times when i glanced at him 
i observed that appearance with a sort of awe  and wondered what he
was thinking about so closely  his hair and whiskers were blacker and
thicker  looked at so near  than even i had given them credit for being 
a squareness about the lower part of his face  and the dotted indication
of the strong black beard he shaved close every day  reminded me of
the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year
before  this  his regular eyebrows  and the rich white  and black  and
brown  of his complexion  confound his complexion  and his memory   made
me think him  in spite of my misgivings  a very handsome man  i have no
doubt that my poor dear mother thought him so too 

we went to an hotel by the sea  where two gentlemen were smoking cigars
in a room by themselves  each of them was lying on at least four chairs 
and had a large rough jacket on  in a corner was a heap of coats and
boat-cloaks  and a flag  all bundled up together 

they both rolled on to their feet in an untidy sort of manner  when we
came in  and said   halloa  murdstone  we thought you were dead  

 not yet   said mr  murdstone 

 and who’s this shaver   said one of the gentlemen  taking hold of me 

 that’s davy   returned mr  murdstone 

 davy who   said the gentleman   jones  

 copperfield   said mr  murdstone 

 what  bewitching mrs  copperfield’s encumbrance   cried the gentleman 
 the pretty little widow  

 quinion   said mr  murdstone   take care  if you please  somebody’s
sharp  

 who is   asked the gentleman  laughing  i looked up  quickly  being
curious to know 

 only brooks of sheffield   said mr  murdstone 

i was quite relieved to find that it was only brooks of sheffield  for 
at first  i really thought it was i 

there seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of mr 
brooks of sheffield  for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he
was mentioned  and mr  murdstone was a good deal amused also  after some
laughing  the gentleman whom he had called quinion  said 

 and what is the opinion of brooks of sheffield  in reference to the
projected business  

 why  i don’t know that brooks understands much about it at present  
replied mr  murdstone   but he is not generally favourable  i believe  

there was more laughter at this  and mr  quinion said he would ring the
bell for some sherry in which to drink to brooks  this he did  and when
the wine came  he made me have a little  with a biscuit  and  before
i drank it  stand up and say   confusion to brooks of sheffield   the
toast was received with great applause  and such hearty laughter that
it made me laugh too  at which they laughed the more  in short  we quite
enjoyed ourselves 

we walked about on the cliff after that  and sat on the grass  and
looked at things through a telescope  i could make out nothing myself
when it was put to my eye  but i pretended i could  and then we came
back to the hotel to an early dinner  all the time we were out  the two
gentlemen smoked incessantly  which  i thought  if i might judge from
the smell of their rough coats  they must have been doing  ever since
the coats had first come home from the tailor’s  i must not forget that
we went on board the yacht  where they all three descended into the
cabin  and were busy with some papers  i saw them quite hard at work 
when i looked down through the open skylight  they left me  during this
time  with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very
small shiny hat upon it  who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat
on  with  skylark  in capital letters across the chest  i thought it was
his name  and that as he lived on board ship and hadn’t a street door
to put his name on  he put it there instead  but when i called him mr 
skylark  he said it meant the vessel 

i observed all day that mr  murdstone was graver and steadier than the
two gentlemen  they were very gay and careless  they joked freely with
one another  but seldom with him  it appeared to me that he was
more clever and cold than they were  and that they regarded him with
something of my own feeling  i remarked that  once or twice when mr 
quinion was talking  he looked at mr  murdstone sideways  as if to make
sure of his not being displeased  and that once when mr  passnidge  the
other gentleman  was in high spirits  he trod upon his foot  and gave
him a secret caution with his eyes  to observe mr  murdstone  who was
sitting stern and silent  nor do i recollect that mr  murdstone laughed
at all that day  except at the sheffield joke  and that  by the by  was
his own 

we went home early in the evening  it was a very fine evening  and my
mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar  while i was sent in
to get my tea  when he was gone  my mother asked me all about the day i
had had  and what they had said and done  i mentioned what they had said
about her  and she laughed  and told me they were impudent fellows who
talked nonsense  but i knew it pleased her  i knew it quite as well as
i know it now  i took the opportunity of asking if she was at all
acquainted with mr  brooks of sheffield  but she answered no  only she
supposed he must be a manufacturer in the knife and fork way 

can i say of her face  altered as i have reason to remember it  perished
as i know it is  that it is gone  when here it comes before me at this
instant  as distinct as any face that i may choose to look on in a
crowded street  can i say of her innocent and girlish beauty  that it
faded  and was no more  when its breath falls on my cheek now  as it
fell that night  can i say she ever changed  when my remembrance brings
her back to life  thus only  and  truer to its loving youth than i have
been  or man ever is  still holds fast what it cherished then 

i write of her just as she was when i had gone to bed after this talk 
and she came to bid me good night  she kneeled down playfully by the
side of the bed  and laying her chin upon her hands  and laughing  said 

 what was it they said  davy  tell me again  i can’t believe it  

  bewitching     i began 

my mother put her hands upon my lips to stop me 

 it was never bewitching   she said  laughing   it never could have been
bewitching  davy  now i know it wasn’t  

 yes  it was   bewitching mrs  copperfield    i repeated stoutly   and 
 pretty   

 no  no  it was never pretty  not pretty   interposed my mother  laying
her fingers on my lips again 

 yes it was   pretty little widow   

 what foolish  impudent creatures   cried my mother  laughing and
covering her face   what ridiculous men  an’t they  davy dear   

 well  ma  

 don’t tell peggotty  she might be angry with them  i am dreadfully
angry with them myself  but i would rather peggotty didn’t know  

i promised  of course  and we kissed one another over and over again 
and i soon fell fast asleep 

it seems to me  at this distance of time  as if it were the next day
when peggotty broached the striking and adventurous proposition i am
about to mention  but it was probably about two months afterwards 

we were sitting as before  one evening  when my mother was out as
before   in company with the stocking and the yard-measure  and the bit
of wax  and the box with st  paul’s on the lid  and the crocodile book 
when peggotty  after looking at me several times  and opening her mouth
as if she were going to speak  without doing it  which i thought was
merely gaping  or i should have been rather alarmed  said coaxingly 

 master davy  how should you like to go along with me and spend a
fortnight at my brother’s at yarmouth  wouldn’t that be a treat  

 is your brother an agreeable man  peggotty   i inquired  provisionally 

 oh  what an agreeable man he is   cried peggotty  holding up her hands 
 then there’s the sea  and the boats and ships  and the fishermen  and
the beach  and am to play with   

peggotty meant her nephew ham  mentioned in my first chapter  but she
spoke of him as a morsel of english grammar 

i was flushed by her summary of delights  and replied that it would
indeed be a treat  but what would my mother say 

 why then i’ll as good as bet a guinea   said peggotty  intent upon my
face   that she’ll let us go  i’ll ask her  if you like  as soon as ever
she comes home  there now  

 but what’s she to do while we’re away   said i  putting my small elbows
on the table to argue the point   she can’t live by herself  

if peggotty were looking for a hole  all of a sudden  in the heel of
that stocking  it must have been a very little one indeed  and not worth
darning 

 i say  peggotty  she can’t live by herself  you know  

 oh  bless you   said peggotty  looking at me again at last   don’t
you know  she’s going to stay for a fortnight with mrs  grayper  mrs 
grayper’s going to have a lot of company  

oh  if that was it  i was quite ready to go  i waited  in the utmost
impatience  until my mother came home from mrs  grayper’s  for it was
that identical neighbour   to ascertain if we could get leave to carry
out this great idea  without being nearly so much surprised as i had
expected  my mother entered into it readily  and it was all arranged
that night  and my board and lodging during the visit were to be paid
for 

the day soon came for our going  it was such an early day that it came
soon  even to me  who was in a fever of expectation  and half afraid
that an earthquake or a fiery mountain  or some other great convulsion
of nature  might interpose to stop the expedition  we were to go in a
carrier’s cart  which departed in the morning after breakfast  i would
have given any money to have been allowed to wrap myself up over-night 
and sleep in my hat and boots 

it touches me nearly now  although i tell it lightly  to recollect how
eager i was to leave my happy home  to think how little i suspected what
i did leave for ever 

i am glad to recollect that when the carrier’s cart was at the gate  and
my mother stood there kissing me  a grateful fondness for her and for
the old place i had never turned my back upon before  made me cry  i am
glad to know that my mother cried too  and that i felt her heart beat
against mine 

i am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move  my mother
ran out at the gate  and called to him to stop  that she might kiss me
once more  i am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which
she lifted up her face to mine  and did so 

as we left her standing in the road  mr  murdstone came up to where
she was  and seemed to expostulate with her for being so moved  i was
looking back round the awning of the cart  and wondered what business
it was of his  peggotty  who was also looking back on the other side 
seemed anything but satisfied  as the face she brought back in the cart
denoted 

i sat looking at peggotty for some time  in a reverie on this
supposititious case  whether  if she were employed to lose me like the
boy in the fairy tale  i should be able to track my way home again by
the buttons she would shed 



chapter 3  i have a change


the carrier’s horse was the laziest horse in the world  i should hope 
and shuffled along  with his head down  as if he liked to keep people
waiting to whom the packages were directed  i fancied  indeed  that he
sometimes chuckled audibly over this reflection  but the carrier said
he was only troubled with a cough  the carrier had a way of keeping his
head down  like his horse  and of drooping sleepily forward as he drove 
with one of his arms on each of his knees  i say  drove   but it struck
me that the cart would have gone to yarmouth quite as well without him 
for the horse did all that  and as to conversation  he had no idea of it
but whistling 

peggotty had a basket of refreshments on her knee  which would have
lasted us out handsomely  if we had been going to london by the same
conveyance  we ate a good deal  and slept a good deal  peggotty always
went to sleep with her chin upon the handle of the basket  her hold of
which never relaxed  and i could not have believed unless i had heard
her do it  that one defenceless woman could have snored so much 

we made so many deviations up and down lanes  and were such a long time
delivering a bedstead at a public-house  and calling at other places 
that i was quite tired  and very glad  when we saw yarmouth  it looked
rather spongy and soppy  i thought  as i carried my eye over the great
dull waste that lay across the river  and i could not help wondering  if
the world were really as round as my geography book said  how any
part of it came to be so flat  but i reflected that yarmouth might be
situated at one of the poles  which would account for it 

as we drew a little nearer  and saw the whole adjacent prospect lying a
straight low line under the sky  i hinted to peggotty that a mound or so
might have improved it  and also that if the land had been a little more
separated from the sea  and the town and the tide had not been quite
so much mixed up  like toast and water  it would have been nicer  but
peggotty said  with greater emphasis than usual  that we must take
things as we found them  and that  for her part  she was proud to call
herself a yarmouth bloater 

when we got into the street  which was strange enough to me  and smelt
the fish  and pitch  and oakum  and tar  and saw the sailors walking
about  and the carts jingling up and down over the stones  i felt that i
had done so busy a place an injustice  and said as much to peggotty  who
heard my expressions of delight with great complacency  and told me it
was well known  i suppose to those who had the good fortune to be born
bloaters  that yarmouth was  upon the whole  the finest place in the
universe 

 here’s my am   screamed peggotty   growed out of knowledge  

he was waiting for us  in fact  at the public-house  and asked me how i
found myself  like an old acquaintance  i did not feel  at first  that
i knew him as well as he knew me  because he had never come to our house
since the night i was born  and naturally he had the advantage of me 
but our intimacy was much advanced by his taking me on his back to carry
me home  he was  now  a huge  strong fellow of six feet high  broad in
proportion  and round-shouldered  but with a simpering boy’s face and
curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look  he was dressed in
a canvas jacket  and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they
would have stood quite as well alone  without any legs in them  and you
couldn’t so properly have said he wore a hat  as that he was covered in
a-top  like an old building  with something pitchy 

ham carrying me on his back and a small box of ours under his arm 
and peggotty carrying another small box of ours  we turned down lanes
bestrewn with bits of chips and little hillocks of sand  and went
past gas-works  rope-walks  boat-builders  yards  shipwrights  yards 
ship-breakers  yards  caulkers  yards  riggers  lofts  smiths  forges 
and a great litter of such places  until we came out upon the dull waste
i had already seen at a distance  when ham said 

 yon’s our house  mas’r davy  

i looked in all directions  as far as i could stare over the wilderness 
and away at the sea  and away at the river  but no house could i make
out  there was a black barge  or some other kind of superannuated boat 
not far off  high and dry on the ground  with an iron funnel sticking
out of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily  but nothing else in the
way of a habitation that was visible to me 

 that’s not it   said i   that ship-looking thing  

 that’s it  mas’r davy   returned ham 

if it had been aladdin’s palace  roc’s egg and all  i suppose i could
not have been more charmed with the romantic idea of living in it  there
was a delightful door cut in the side  and it was roofed in  and there
were little windows in it  but the wonderful charm of it was  that
it was a real boat which had no doubt been upon the water hundreds of
times  and which had never been intended to be lived in  on dry land 
that was the captivation of it to me  if it had ever been meant to be
lived in  i might have thought it small  or inconvenient  or lonely  but
never having been designed for any such use  it became a perfect abode 

it was beautifully clean inside  and as tidy as possible  there was a
table  and a dutch clock  and a chest of drawers  and on the chest of
drawers there was a tea-tray with a painting on it of a lady with a
parasol  taking a walk with a military-looking child who was trundling a
hoop  the tray was kept from tumbling down  by a bible  and the tray  if
it had tumbled down  would have smashed a quantity of cups and saucers
and a teapot that were grouped around the book  on the walls there were
some common coloured pictures  framed and glazed  of scripture subjects 
such as i have never seen since in the hands of pedlars  without seeing
the whole interior of peggotty’s brother’s house again  at one view 
abraham in red going to sacrifice isaac in blue  and daniel in yellow
cast into a den of green lions  were the most prominent of these  over
the little mantelshelf  was a picture of the  sarah jane  lugger  built
at sunderland  with a real little wooden stern stuck on to it  a work of
art  combining composition with carpentry  which i considered to be one
of the most enviable possessions that the world could afford  there
were some hooks in the beams of the ceiling  the use of which i did not
divine then  and some lockers and boxes and conveniences of that sort 
which served for seats and eked out the chairs 

all this i saw in the first glance after i crossed the
threshold  child-like  according to my theory  and then peggotty opened
a little door and showed me my bedroom  it was the completest and most
desirable bedroom ever seen  in the stern of the vessel  with a little
window  where the rudder used to go through  a little looking-glass 
just the right height for me  nailed against the wall  and framed with
oyster-shells  a little bed  which there was just room enough to get
into  and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table  the walls
were whitewashed as white as milk  and the patchwork counterpane made my
eyes quite ache with its brightness  one thing i particularly noticed
in this delightful house  was the smell of fish  which was so searching 
that when i took out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe my nose  i found it
smelt exactly as if it had wrapped up a lobster  on my imparting this
discovery in confidence to peggotty  she informed me that her brother
dealt in lobsters  crabs  and crawfish  and i afterwards found that a
heap of these creatures  in a state of wonderful conglomeration with one
another  and never leaving off pinching whatever they laid hold of 
were usually to be found in a little wooden outhouse where the pots and
kettles were kept 

we were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron  whom i had seen
curtseying at the door when i was on ham’s back  about a quarter of a
mile off  likewise by a most beautiful little girl  or i thought her so 
with a necklace of blue beads on  who wouldn’t let me kiss her when i
offered to  but ran away and hid herself  by and by  when we had dined
in a sumptuous manner off boiled dabs  melted butter  and potatoes  with
a chop for me  a hairy man with a very good-natured face came home  as
he called peggotty  lass   and gave her a hearty smack on the cheek  i
had no doubt  from the general propriety of her conduct  that he was her
brother  and so he turned out  being presently introduced to me as mr 
peggotty  the master of the house 

 glad to see you  sir   said mr  peggotty   you’ll find us rough  sir 
but you’ll find us ready  

i thanked him  and replied that i was sure i should be happy in such a
delightful place 

 how’s your ma  sir   said mr  peggotty   did you leave her pretty
jolly  

i gave mr  peggotty to understand that she was as jolly as i could wish 
and that she desired her compliments  which was a polite fiction on my
part 

 i’m much obleeged to her  i’m sure   said mr  peggotty   well  sir 
if you can make out here  fur a fortnut   long wi  her   nodding at his
sister   and ham  and little em’ly  we shall be proud of your company  

having done the honours of his house in this hospitable manner  mr 
peggotty went out to wash himself in a kettleful of hot water  remarking
that  cold would never get his muck off   he soon returned  greatly
improved in appearance  but so rubicund  that i couldn’t help
thinking his face had this in common with the lobsters  crabs  and
crawfish   that it went into the hot water very black  and came out very
red 

after tea  when the door was shut and all was made snug  the nights
being cold and misty now   it seemed to me the most delicious retreat
that the imagination of man could conceive  to hear the wind getting
up out at sea  to know that the fog was creeping over the desolate flat
outside  and to look at the fire  and think that there was no house near
but this one  and this one a boat  was like enchantment  little em’ly
had overcome her shyness  and was sitting by my side upon the lowest and
least of the lockers  which was just large enough for us two  and just
fitted into the chimney corner  mrs  peggotty with the white apron  was
knitting on the opposite side of the fire  peggotty at her needlework
was as much at home with st  paul’s and the bit of wax-candle  as if
they had never known any other roof  ham  who had been giving me my
first lesson in all-fours  was trying to recollect a scheme of telling
fortunes with the dirty cards  and was printing off fishy impressions of
his thumb on all the cards he turned  mr  peggotty was smoking his pipe 
i felt it was a time for conversation and confidence 

 mr  peggotty   says i 

 sir   says he 

 did you give your son the name of ham  because you lived in a sort of
ark  

mr  peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea  but answered 

 no  sir  i never giv him no name  

 who gave him that name  then   said i  putting question number two of
the catechism to mr  peggotty 

 why  sir  his father giv it him   said mr  peggotty 

 i thought you were his father  

 my brother joe was his father   said mr  peggotty 

 dead  mr  peggotty   i hinted  after a respectful pause 

 drowndead   said mr  peggotty 

i was very much surprised that mr  peggotty was not ham’s father  and
began to wonder whether i was mistaken about his relationship to anybody
else there  i was so curious to know  that i made up my mind to have it
out with mr  peggotty 

 little em’ly   i said  glancing at her   she is your daughter  isn’t
she  mr  peggotty  

 no  sir  my brother-in-law  tom  was her father  

i couldn’t help it     dead  mr  peggotty   i hinted  after another
respectful silence 

 drowndead   said mr  peggotty 

i felt the difficulty of resuming the subject  but had not got to the
bottom of it yet  and must get to the bottom somehow  so i said 

 haven’t you any children  mr  peggotty  

 no  master   he answered with a short laugh   i’m a bacheldore  

 a bachelor   i said  astonished   why  who’s that  mr  peggotty  
pointing to the person in the apron who was knitting 

 that’s missis gummidge   said mr  peggotty 

 gummidge  mr  peggotty  

but at this point peggotty  i mean my own peculiar peggotty  made such
impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions  that i could
only sit and look at all the silent company  until it was time to go to
bed  then  in the privacy of my own little cabin  she informed me that
ham and em’ly were an orphan nephew and niece  whom my host had
at different times adopted in their childhood  when they were left
destitute  and that mrs  gummidge was the widow of his partner in
a boat  who had died very poor  he was but a poor man himself  said
peggotty  but as good as gold and as true as steel  those were her
similes  the only subject  she informed me  on which he ever showed a
violent temper or swore an oath  was this generosity of his  and if it
were ever referred to  by any one of them  he struck the table a heavy
blow with his right hand  had split it on one such occasion   and swore
a dreadful oath that he would be  gormed  if he didn’t cut and run
for good  if it was ever mentioned again  it appeared  in answer to
my inquiries  that nobody had the least idea of the etymology of this
terrible verb passive to be gormed  but that they all regarded it as
constituting a most solemn imprecation 

i was very sensible of my entertainer’s goodness  and listened to the
women’s going to bed in another little crib like mine at the opposite
end of the boat  and to him and ham hanging up two hammocks for
themselves on the hooks i had noticed in the roof  in a very luxurious
state of mind  enhanced by my being sleepy  as slumber gradually stole
upon me  i heard the wind howling out at sea and coming on across the
flat so fiercely  that i had a lazy apprehension of the great deep
rising in the night  but i bethought myself that i was in a boat  after
all  and that a man like mr  peggotty was not a bad person to have on
board if anything did happen 

nothing happened  however  worse than morning  almost as soon as it
shone upon the oyster-shell frame of my mirror i was out of bed  and out
with little em’ly  picking up stones upon the beach 

 you’re quite a sailor  i suppose   i said to em’ly  i don’t know that i
supposed anything of the kind  but i felt it an act of gallantry to
say something  and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty little
image of itself  at the moment  in her bright eye  that it came into my
head to say this 

 no   replied em’ly  shaking her head   i’m afraid of the sea  

 afraid   i said  with a becoming air of boldness  and looking very big
at the mighty ocean   i an’t  

 ah  but it’s cruel   said em’ly   i have seen it very cruel to some of
our men  i have seen it tear a boat as big as our house  all to pieces  

 i hope it wasn’t the boat that   

 that father was drownded in   said em’ly   no  not that one  i never
see that boat  

 nor him   i asked her 

little em’ly shook her head   not to remember  

here was a coincidence  i immediately went into an explanation how i had
never seen my own father  and how my mother and i had always lived
by ourselves in the happiest state imaginable  and lived so then  and
always meant to live so  and how my father’s grave was in the churchyard
near our house  and shaded by a tree  beneath the boughs of which i had
walked and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning  but there were
some differences between em’ly’s orphanhood and mine  it appeared  she
had lost her mother before her father  and where her father’s grave was
no one knew  except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea 

 besides   said em’ly  as she looked about for shells and pebbles   your
father was a gentleman and your mother is a lady  and my father was a
fisherman and my mother was a fisherman’s daughter  and my uncle dan is
a fisherman  

 dan is mr  peggotty  is he   said i 

 uncle dan  yonder   answered em’ly  nodding at the boat-house 

 yes  i mean him  he must be very good  i should think  

 good   said em’ly   if i was ever to be a lady  i’d give him a sky-blue
coat with diamond buttons  nankeen trousers  a red velvet waistcoat  a
cocked hat  a large gold watch  a silver pipe  and a box of money  

i said i had no doubt that mr  peggotty well deserved these treasures 
i must acknowledge that i felt it difficult to picture him quite at his
ease in the raiment proposed for him by his grateful little niece  and
that i was particularly doubtful of the policy of the cocked hat  but i
kept these sentiments to myself 

little em’ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration
of these articles  as if they were a glorious vision  we went on again 
picking up shells and pebbles 

 you would like to be a lady   i said 

emily looked at me  and laughed and nodded  yes  

 i should like it very much  we would all be gentlefolks together  then 
me  and uncle  and ham  and mrs  gummidge  we wouldn’t mind then  when
there comes stormy weather    not for our own sakes  i mean  we would
for the poor fishermen’s  to be sure  and we’d help  em with money when
they come to any hurt   this seemed to me to be a very satisfactory and
therefore not at all improbable picture  i expressed my pleasure in the
contemplation of it  and little em’ly was emboldened to say  shyly 

 don’t you think you are afraid of the sea  now  

it was quiet enough to reassure me  but i have no doubt if i had seen a
moderately large wave come tumbling in  i should have taken to my heels 
with an awful recollection of her drowned relations  however  i said
 no   and i added   you don’t seem to be either  though you say you
are    for she was walking much too near the brink of a sort of old
jetty or wooden causeway we had strolled upon  and i was afraid of her
falling over 

 i’m not afraid in this way   said little em’ly   but i wake when it
blows  and tremble to think of uncle dan and ham and believe i hear  em
crying out for help  that’s why i should like so much to be a lady  but
i’m not afraid in this way  not a bit  look here  

she started from my side  and ran along a jagged timber which protruded
from the place we stood upon  and overhung the deep water at some
height  without the least defence  the incident is so impressed on my
remembrance  that if i were a draughtsman i could draw its form here 
i dare say  accurately as it was that day  and little em’ly springing
forward to her destruction  as it appeared to me   with a look that i
have never forgotten  directed far out to sea 

the light  bold  fluttering little figure turned and came back safe
to me  and i soon laughed at my fears  and at the cry i had uttered 
fruitlessly in any case  for there was no one near  but there have been
times since  in my manhood  many times there have been  when i have
thought  is it possible  among the possibilities of hidden things  that
in the sudden rashness of the child and her wild look so far off  there
was any merciful attraction of her into danger  any tempting her towards
him permitted on the part of her dead father  that her life might have
a chance of ending that day  there has been a time since when i have
wondered whether  if the life before her could have been revealed to me
at a glance  and so revealed as that a child could fully comprehend it 
and if her preservation could have depended on a motion of my hand  i
ought to have held it up to save her  there has been a time since  i do
not say it lasted long  but it has been  when i have asked myself the
question  would it have been better for little em’ly to have had the
waters close above her head that morning in my sight  and when i have
answered yes  it would have been 

this may be premature  i have set it down too soon  perhaps  but let it
stand 

we strolled a long way  and loaded ourselves with things that we thought
curious  and put some stranded starfish carefully back into the water  i
hardly know enough of the race at this moment to be quite certain
whether they had reason to feel obliged to us for doing so  or the
reverse  and then made our way home to mr  peggotty’s dwelling  we
stopped under the lee of the lobster-outhouse to exchange an innocent
kiss  and went in to breakfast glowing with health and pleasure 

 like two young mavishes   mr  peggotty said  i knew this meant  in our
local dialect  like two young thrushes  and received it as a compliment 

of course i was in love with little em’ly  i am sure i loved that
baby quite as truly  quite as tenderly  with greater purity and more
disinterestedness  than can enter into the best love of a later time
of life  high and ennobling as it is  i am sure my fancy raised up
something round that blue-eyed mite of a child  which etherealized 
and made a very angel of her  if  any sunny forenoon  she had spread
a little pair of wings and flown away before my eyes  i don’t think i
should have regarded it as much more than i had had reason to expect 

we used to walk about that dim old flat at yarmouth in a loving manner 
hours and hours  the days sported by us  as if time had not grown up
himself yet  but were a child too  and always at play  i told em’ly
i adored her  and that unless she confessed she adored me i should be
reduced to the necessity of killing myself with a sword  she said she
did  and i have no doubt she did 

as to any sense of inequality  or youthfulness  or other difficulty
in our way  little em’ly and i had no such trouble  because we had no
future  we made no more provision for growing older  than we did for
growing younger  we were the admiration of mrs  gummidge and peggotty 
who used to whisper of an evening when we sat  lovingly  on our little
locker side by side   lor  wasn’t it beautiful   mr  peggotty smiled at
us from behind his pipe  and ham grinned all the evening and did nothing
else  they had something of the sort of pleasure in us  i suppose  that
they might have had in a pretty toy  or a pocket model of the colosseum 

i soon found out that mrs  gummidge did not always make herself so
agreeable as she might have been expected to do  under the circumstances
of her residence with mr  peggotty  mrs  gummidge’s was rather a fretful
disposition  and she whimpered more sometimes than was comfortable for
other parties in so small an establishment  i was very sorry for
her  but there were moments when it would have been more agreeable  i
thought  if mrs  gummidge had had a convenient apartment of her own to
retire to  and had stopped there until her spirits revived 

mr  peggotty went occasionally to a public-house called the willing
mind  i discovered this  by his being out on the second or third evening
of our visit  and by mrs  gummidge’s looking up at the dutch clock 
between eight and nine  and saying he was there  and that  what was
more  she had known in the morning he would go there 

mrs  gummidge had been in a low state all day  and had burst into tears
in the forenoon  when the fire smoked   i am a lone lorn creetur    were
mrs  gummidge’s words  when that unpleasant occurrence took place   and
everythink goes contrary with me  

 oh  it’ll soon leave off   said peggotty  i again mean our
peggotty   and besides  you know  it’s not more disagreeable to you than
to us  

 i feel it more   said mrs  gummidge 

it was a very cold day  with cutting blasts of wind  mrs  gummidge’s
peculiar corner of the fireside seemed to me to be the warmest and
snuggest in the place  as her chair was certainly the easiest  but it
didn’t suit her that day at all  she was constantly complaining of the
cold  and of its occasioning a visitation in her back which she called
 the creeps   at last she shed tears on that subject  and said again
that she was  a lone lorn creetur  and everythink went contrary with
her  

 it is certainly very cold   said peggotty   everybody must feel it so  

 i feel it more than other people   said mrs  gummidge 

so at dinner  when mrs  gummidge was always helped immediately after me 
to whom the preference was given as a visitor of distinction  the
fish were small and bony  and the potatoes were a little burnt  we all
acknowledged that we felt this something of a disappointment  but mrs 
gummidge said she felt it more than we did  and shed tears again  and
made that former declaration with great bitterness 

accordingly  when mr  peggotty came home about nine o’clock  this
unfortunate mrs  gummidge was knitting in her corner  in a very wretched
and miserable condition  peggotty had been working cheerfully  ham had
been patching up a great pair of waterboots  and i  with little em’ly
by my side  had been reading to them  mrs  gummidge had never made any
other remark than a forlorn sigh  and had never raised her eyes since
tea 

 well  mates   said mr  peggotty  taking his seat   and how are you  

we all said something  or looked something  to welcome him  except mrs 
gummidge  who only shook her head over her knitting 

 what’s amiss   said mr  peggotty  with a clap of his hands   cheer up 
old mawther    mr  peggotty meant old girl  

mrs  gummidge did not appear to be able to cheer up  she took out an old
black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes  but instead of putting it
in her pocket  kept it out  and wiped them again  and still kept it out 
ready for use 

 what’s amiss  dame   said mr  peggotty 

 nothing   returned mrs  gummidge   you’ve come from the willing mind 
dan’l  

 why yes  i’ve took a short spell at the willing mind tonight   said mr 
peggotty 

 i’m sorry i should drive you there   said mrs  gummidge 

 drive  i don’t want no driving   returned mr  peggotty with an honest
laugh   i only go too ready  

 very ready   said mrs  gummidge  shaking her head  and wiping her eyes 
 yes  yes  very ready  i am sorry it should be along of me that you’re
so ready  

 along o  you  it an’t along o  you   said mr  peggotty   don’t ye
believe a bit on it  

 yes  yes  it is   cried mrs  gummidge   i know what i am  i know that i
am a lone lorn creetur   and not only that everythink goes contrary with
me  but that i go contrary with everybody  yes  yes  i feel more than
other people do  and i show it more  it’s my misfortun   

i really couldn’t help thinking  as i sat taking in all this  that the
misfortune extended to some other members of that family besides mrs 
gummidge  but mr  peggotty made no such retort  only answering with
another entreaty to mrs  gummidge to cheer up 

 i an’t what i could wish myself to be   said mrs  gummidge   i am far
from it  i know what i am  my troubles has made me contrary  i feel my
troubles  and they make me contrary  i wish i didn’t feel  em  but i
do  i wish i could be hardened to  em  but i an’t  i make the house
uncomfortable  i don’t wonder at it  i’ve made your sister so all day 
and master davy  

here i was suddenly melted  and roared out   no  you haven’t  mrs 
gummidge   in great mental distress 

 it’s far from right that i should do it   said mrs  gummidge   it an’t
a fit return  i had better go into the house and die  i am a lone lorn
creetur   and had much better not make myself contrary here  if thinks
must go contrary with me  and i must go contrary myself  let me go
contrary in my parish  dan’l  i’d better go into the house  and die and
be a riddance  

mrs  gummidge retired with these words  and betook herself to bed  when
she was gone  mr  peggotty  who had not exhibited a trace of any feeling
but the profoundest sympathy  looked round upon us  and nodding his head
with a lively expression of that sentiment still animating his face 
said in a whisper 

 she’s been thinking of the old  un  

i did not quite understand what old one mrs  gummidge was supposed to
have fixed her mind upon  until peggotty  on seeing me to bed  explained
that it was the late mr  gummidge  and that her brother always took that
for a received truth on such occasions  and that it always had a moving
effect upon him  some time after he was in his hammock that night  i
heard him myself repeat to ham   poor thing  she’s been thinking of the
old  un   and whenever mrs  gummidge was overcome in a similar manner
during the remainder of our stay  which happened some few times   he
always said the same thing in extenuation of the circumstance  and
always with the tenderest commiseration 

so the fortnight slipped away  varied by nothing but the variation of
the tide  which altered mr  peggotty’s times of going out and coming in 
and altered ham’s engagements also  when the latter was unemployed  he
sometimes walked with us to show us the boats and ships  and once
or twice he took us for a row  i don’t know why one slight set of
impressions should be more particularly associated with a place than
another  though i believe this obtains with most people  in reference
especially to the associations of their childhood  i never hear the
name  or read the name  of yarmouth  but i am reminded of a certain
sunday morning on the beach  the bells ringing for church  little em’ly
leaning on my shoulder  ham lazily dropping stones into the water  and
the sun  away at sea  just breaking through the heavy mist  and showing
us the ships  like their own shadows 

at last the day came for going home  i bore up against the separation
from mr  peggotty and mrs  gummidge  but my agony of mind at leaving
little em’ly was piercing  we went arm-in-arm to the public-house where
the carrier put up  and i promised  on the road  to write to her   i
redeemed that promise afterwards  in characters larger than those in
which apartments are usually announced in manuscript  as being to let  
we were greatly overcome at parting  and if ever  in my life  i have had
a void made in my heart  i had one made that day 

now  all the time i had been on my visit  i had been ungrateful to my
home again  and had thought little or nothing about it  but i was no
sooner turned towards it  than my reproachful young conscience seemed
to point that way with a ready finger  and i felt  all the more for the
sinking of my spirits  that it was my nest  and that my mother was my
comforter and friend 

this gained upon me as we went along  so that the nearer we drew  the
more familiar the objects became that we passed  the more excited i was
to get there  and to run into her arms  but peggotty  instead of sharing
in those transports  tried to check them  though very kindly   and
looked confused and out of sorts 

blunderstone rookery would come  however  in spite of her  when the
carrier’s horse pleased  and did  how well i recollect it  on a cold
grey afternoon  with a dull sky  threatening rain 

the door opened  and i looked  half laughing and half crying in my
pleasant agitation  for my mother  it was not she  but a strange
servant 

 why  peggotty   i said  ruefully   isn’t she come home  

 yes  yes  master davy   said peggotty   she’s come home  wait a bit 
master davy  and i’ll  i’ll tell you something  

between her agitation  and her natural awkwardness in getting out of the
cart  peggotty was making a most extraordinary festoon of herself  but
i felt too blank and strange to tell her so  when she had got down  she
took me by the hand  led me  wondering  into the kitchen  and shut the
door 

 peggotty   said i  quite frightened   what’s the matter  

 nothing’s the matter  bless you  master davy dear   she answered 
assuming an air of sprightliness 

 something’s the matter  i’m sure  where’s mama  

 where’s mama  master davy   repeated peggotty 

 yes  why hasn’t she come out to the gate  and what have we come in here
for  oh  peggotty   my eyes were full  and i felt as if i were going to
tumble down 

 bless the precious boy   cried peggotty  taking hold of me   what is
it  speak  my pet  

 not dead  too  oh  she’s not dead  peggotty  

peggotty cried out no  with an astonishing volume of voice  and then sat
down  and began to pant  and said i had given her a turn 

i gave her a hug to take away the turn  or to give her another turn
in the right direction  and then stood before her  looking at her in
anxious inquiry 

 you see  dear  i should have told you before now   said peggotty 
 but i hadn’t an opportunity  i ought to have made it  perhaps  but
i couldn’t azackly   that was always the substitute for exactly  in
peggotty’s militia of words   bring my mind to it  

 go on  peggotty   said i  more frightened than before 

 master davy   said peggotty  untying her bonnet with a shaking hand 
and speaking in a breathless sort of way   what do you think  you have
got a pa  

i trembled  and turned white  something  i don’t know what  or
how  connected with the grave in the churchyard  and the raising of the
dead  seemed to strike me like an unwholesome wind 

 a new one   said peggotty 

 a new one   i repeated 

peggotty gave a gasp  as if she were swallowing something that was very
hard  and  putting out her hand  said 

 come and see him  

 i don’t want to see him      and your mama   said peggotty 

i ceased to draw back  and we went straight to the best parlour  where
she left me  on one side of the fire  sat my mother  on the other  mr 
murdstone  my mother dropped her work  and arose hurriedly  but timidly
i thought 

 now  clara my dear   said mr  murdstone   recollect  control yourself 
always control yourself  davy boy  how do you do  

i gave him my hand  after a moment of suspense  i went and kissed my
mother  she kissed me  patted me gently on the shoulder  and sat down
again to her work  i could not look at her  i could not look at him 
i knew quite well that he was looking at us both  and i turned to the
window and looked out there  at some shrubs that were drooping their
heads in the cold 

as soon as i could creep away  i crept upstairs  my old dear bedroom was
changed  and i was to lie a long way off  i rambled downstairs to find
anything that was like itself  so altered it all seemed  and roamed into
the yard  i very soon started back from there  for the empty dog-kennel
was filled up with a great dog  deep mouthed and black-haired like
him  and he was very angry at the sight of me  and sprang out to get at
me 



chapter 4  i fall into disgrace


if the room to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could
give evidence  i might appeal to it at this day  who sleeps there now 
i wonder   to bear witness for me what a heavy heart i carried to it 
i went up there  hearing the dog in the yard bark after me all the way
while i climbed the stairs  and  looking as blank and strange upon the
room as the room looked upon me  sat down with my small hands crossed 
and thought 

i thought of the oddest things  of the shape of the room  of the
cracks in the ceiling  of the paper on the walls  of the flaws in
the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect  of the
washing-stand being rickety on its three legs  and having a discontented
something about it  which reminded me of mrs  gummidge under the
influence of the old one  i was crying all the time  but  except that i
was conscious of being cold and dejected  i am sure i never thought
why i cried  at last in my desolation i began to consider that i was
dreadfully in love with little em’ly  and had been torn away from her to
come here where no one seemed to want me  or to care about me  half as
much as she did  this made such a very miserable piece of business of
it  that i rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane  and cried
myself to sleep 

i was awoke by somebody saying  here he is   and uncovering my hot head 
my mother and peggotty had come to look for me  and it was one of them
who had done it 

 davy   said my mother   what’s the matter  

i thought it was very strange that she should ask me  and answered 
 nothing   i turned over on my face  i recollect  to hide my trembling
lip  which answered her with greater truth   davy   said my mother 
 davy  my child  

i dare say no words she could have uttered would have affected me
so much  then  as her calling me her child  i hid my tears in the
bedclothes  and pressed her from me with my hand  when she would have
raised me up 

 this is your doing  peggotty  you cruel thing   said my mother   i have
no doubt at all about it  how can you reconcile it to your conscience 
i wonder  to prejudice my own boy against me  or against anybody who is
dear to me  what do you mean by it  peggotty  

poor peggotty lifted up her hands and eyes  and only answered  in a
sort of paraphrase of the grace i usually repeated after dinner   lord
forgive you  mrs  copperfield  and for what you have said this minute 
may you never be truly sorry  

 it’s enough to distract me   cried my mother   in my honeymoon  too 
when my most inveterate enemy might relent  one would think  and not
envy me a little peace of mind and happiness  davy  you naughty boy 
peggotty  you savage creature  oh  dear me   cried my mother  turning
from one of us to the other  in her pettish wilful manner   what a
troublesome world this is  when one has the most right to expect it to
be as agreeable as possible  

i felt the touch of a hand that i knew was neither hers nor peggotty’s 
and slipped to my feet at the bed-side  it was mr  murdstone’s hand  and
he kept it on my arm as he said 

 what’s this  clara  my love  have you forgotten   firmness  my dear  

 i am very sorry  edward   said my mother   i meant to be very good  but
i am so uncomfortable  

 indeed   he answered   that’s a bad hearing  so soon  clara  

 i say it’s very hard i should be made so now   returned my mother 
pouting   and it is  very hard  isn’t it  

he drew her to him  whispered in her ear  and kissed her  i knew as
well  when i saw my mother’s head lean down upon his shoulder  and her
arm touch his neck  i knew as well that he could mould her pliant nature
into any form he chose  as i know  now  that he did it 

 go you below  my love   said mr  murdstone   david and i will come
down  together  my friend   turning a darkening face on peggotty  when
he had watched my mother out  and dismissed her with a nod and a smile 
 do you know your mistress’s name  

 she has been my mistress a long time  sir   answered peggotty   i ought
to know it    that’s true   he answered   but i thought i heard you  as
i came upstairs  address her by a name that is not hers  she has taken
mine  you know  will you remember that  

peggotty  with some uneasy glances at me  curtseyed herself out of the
room without replying  seeing  i suppose  that she was expected to go 
and had no excuse for remaining  when we two were left alone  he shut
the door  and sitting on a chair  and holding me standing before him 
looked steadily into my eyes  i felt my own attracted  no less steadily 
to his  as i recall our being opposed thus  face to face  i seem again
to hear my heart beat fast and high 

 david   he said  making his lips thin  by pressing them together   if i
have an obstinate horse or dog to deal with  what do you think i do  

 i don’t know  

 i beat him  

i had answered in a kind of breathless whisper  but i felt  in my
silence  that my breath was shorter now 

 i make him wince  and smart  i say to myself   i’ll conquer that
fellow   and if it were to cost him all the blood he had  i should do
it  what is that upon your face  

 dirt   i said 

he knew it was the mark of tears as well as i  but if he had asked the
question twenty times  each time with twenty blows  i believe my baby
heart would have burst before i would have told him so 

 you have a good deal of intelligence for a little fellow   he said 
with a grave smile that belonged to him   and you understood me very
well  i see  wash that face  sir  and come down with me  

he pointed to the washing-stand  which i had made out to be like mrs 
gummidge  and motioned me with his head to obey him directly  i had
little doubt then  and i have less doubt now  that he would have knocked
me down without the least compunction  if i had hesitated 

 clara  my dear   he said  when i had done his bidding  and he walked me
into the parlour  with his hand still on my arm   you will not be made
uncomfortable any more  i hope  we shall soon improve our youthful
humours  

god help me  i might have been improved for my whole life  i might have
been made another creature perhaps  for life  by a kind word at that
season  a word of encouragement and explanation  of pity for my childish
ignorance  of welcome home  of reassurance to me that it was home  might
have made me dutiful to him in my heart henceforth  instead of in my
hypocritical outside  and might have made me respect instead of hate
him  i thought my mother was sorry to see me standing in the room so
scared and strange  and that  presently  when i stole to a chair  she
followed me with her eyes more sorrowfully still  missing  perhaps  some
freedom in my childish tread  but the word was not spoken  and the time
for it was gone 

we dined alone  we three together  he seemed to be very fond of my
mother  i am afraid i liked him none the better for that  and she was
very fond of him  i gathered from what they said  that an elder sister
of his was coming to stay with them  and that she was expected that
evening  i am not certain whether i found out then  or afterwards  that 
without being actively concerned in any business  he had some share in 
or some annual charge upon the profits of  a wine-merchant’s house
in london  with which his family had been connected from his
great-grandfather’s time  and in which his sister had a similar
interest  but i may mention it in this place  whether or no 

after dinner  when we were sitting by the fire  and i was meditating an
escape to peggotty without having the hardihood to slip away  lest
it should offend the master of the house  a coach drove up to the
garden-gate and he went out to receive the visitor  my mother followed
him  i was timidly following her  when she turned round at the parlour
door  in the dusk  and taking me in her embrace as she had been used to
do  whispered me to love my new father and be obedient to him  she did
this hurriedly and secretly  as if it were wrong  but tenderly  and 
putting out her hand behind her  held mine in it  until we came near
to where he was standing in the garden  where she let mine go  and drew
hers through his arm 

it was miss murdstone who was arrived  and a gloomy-looking lady she
was  dark  like her brother  whom she greatly resembled in face and
voice  and with very heavy eyebrows  nearly meeting over her large nose 
as if  being disabled by the wrongs of her sex from wearing whiskers 
she had carried them to that account  she brought with her two
uncompromising hard black boxes  with her initials on the lids in hard
brass nails  when she paid the coachman she took her money out of a hard
steel purse  and she kept the purse in a very jail of a bag which hung
upon her arm by a heavy chain  and shut up like a bite  i had never  at
that time  seen such a metallic lady altogether as miss murdstone was 

she was brought into the parlour with many tokens of welcome  and there
formally recognized my mother as a new and near relation  then she
looked at me  and said 

 is that your boy  sister-in-law  

my mother acknowledged me 

 generally speaking   said miss murdstone   i don’t like boys  how d’ye
do  boy  

under these encouraging circumstances  i replied that i was very well 
and that i hoped she was the same  with such an indifferent grace  that
miss murdstone disposed of me in two words 

 wants manner  

having uttered which  with great distinctness  she begged the favour of
being shown to her room  which became to me from that time forth a place
of awe and dread  wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or
known to be left unlocked  and where  for i peeped in once or twice when
she was out  numerous little steel fetters and rivets  with which miss
murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed  generally hung upon
the looking-glass in formidable array 

as well as i could make out  she had come for good  and had no intention
of ever going again  she began to  help  my mother next morning  and was
in and out of the store-closet all day  putting things to rights  and
making havoc in the old arrangements  almost the first remarkable thing
i observed in miss murdstone was  her being constantly haunted by
a suspicion that the servants had a man secreted somewhere on the
premises  under the influence of this delusion  she dived into the
coal-cellar at the most untimely hours  and scarcely ever opened the
door of a dark cupboard without clapping it to again  in the belief that
she had got him 

though there was nothing very airy about miss murdstone  she was a
perfect lark in point of getting up  she was up  and  as i believe
to this hour  looking for that man  before anybody in the house was
stirring  peggotty gave it as her opinion that she even slept with one
eye open  but i could not concur in this idea  for i tried it myself
after hearing the suggestion thrown out  and found it couldn’t be done 

on the very first morning after her arrival she was up and ringing her
bell at cock-crow  when my mother came down to breakfast and was going
to make the tea  miss murdstone gave her a kind of peck on the cheek 
which was her nearest approach to a kiss  and said 

 now  clara  my dear  i am come here  you know  to relieve you of all
the trouble i can  you’re much too pretty and thoughtless   my mother
blushed but laughed  and seemed not to dislike this character   to have
any duties imposed upon you that can be undertaken by me  if you’ll be
so good as give me your keys  my dear  i’ll attend to all this sort of
thing in future  

from that time  miss murdstone kept the keys in her own little jail all
day  and under her pillow all night  and my mother had no more to do
with them than i had 

my mother did not suffer her authority to pass from her without a shadow
of protest  one night when miss murdstone had been developing certain
household plans to her brother  of which he signified his approbation 
my mother suddenly began to cry  and said she thought she might have
been consulted 

 clara   said mr  murdstone sternly   clara  i wonder at you  

 oh  it’s very well to say you wonder  edward   cried my mother   and
it’s very well for you to talk about firmness  but you wouldn’t like it
yourself  

firmness  i may observe  was the grand quality on which both mr  and
miss murdstone took their stand  however i might have expressed
my comprehension of it at that time  if i had been called upon  i
nevertheless did clearly comprehend in my own way  that it was another
name for tyranny  and for a certain gloomy  arrogant  devil’s humour 
that was in them both  the creed  as i should state it now  was this 
mr  murdstone was firm  nobody in his world was to be so firm as mr 
murdstone  nobody else in his world was to be firm at all  for everybody
was to be bent to his firmness  miss murdstone was an exception 
she might be firm  but only by relationship  and in an inferior and
tributary degree  my mother was another exception  she might be firm 
and must be  but only in bearing their firmness  and firmly believing
there was no other firmness upon earth 

 it’s very hard   said my mother   that in my own house   

 my own house   repeated mr  murdstone   clara  

 our own house  i mean   faltered my mother  evidently frightened   i
hope you must know what i mean  edward  it’s very hard that in your own
house i may not have a word to say about domestic matters  i am sure
i managed very well before we were married  there’s evidence   said my
mother  sobbing   ask peggotty if i didn’t do very well when i wasn’t
interfered with  

 edward   said miss murdstone   let there be an end of this  i go
tomorrow  

 jane murdstone   said her brother   be silent  how dare you to
insinuate that you don’t know my character better than your words
imply  

 i am sure   my poor mother went on  at a grievous disadvantage  and
with many tears   i don’t want anybody to go  i should be very
miserable and unhappy if anybody was to go  i don’t ask much  i am not
unreasonable  i only want to be consulted sometimes  i am very much
obliged to anybody who assists me  and i only want to be consulted as a
mere form  sometimes  i thought you were pleased  once  with my being a
little inexperienced and girlish  edward  i am sure you said so  but you
seem to hate me for it now  you are so severe  

 edward   said miss murdstone  again   let there be an end of this  i go
tomorrow  

 jane murdstone   thundered mr  murdstone   will you be silent  how dare
you  

miss murdstone made a jail-delivery of her pocket-handkerchief  and held
it before her eyes 

 clara   he continued  looking at my mother   you surprise me  you
astound me  yes  i had a satisfaction in the thought of marrying
an inexperienced and artless person  and forming her character  and
infusing into it some amount of that firmness and decision of which
it stood in need  but when jane murdstone is kind enough to come to my
assistance in this endeavour  and to assume  for my sake  a condition
something like a housekeeper’s  and when she meets with a base return   

 oh  pray  pray  edward   cried my mother   don’t accuse me of being
ungrateful  i am sure i am not ungrateful  no one ever said i was
before  i have many faults  but not that  oh  don’t  my dear  

 when jane murdstone meets  i say   he went on  after waiting until my
mother was silent   with a base return  that feeling of mine is chilled
and altered  

 don’t  my love  say that   implored my mother very piteously 
 oh  don’t  edward  i can’t bear to hear it  whatever i am  i am
affectionate  i know i am affectionate  i wouldn’t say it  if i
wasn’t sure that i am  ask peggotty  i am sure she’ll tell you i’m
affectionate  

 there is no extent of mere weakness  clara   said mr  murdstone in
reply   that can have the least weight with me  you lose breath  

 pray let us be friends   said my mother   i couldn’t live under
coldness or unkindness  i am so sorry  i have a great many defects  i
know  and it’s very good of you  edward  with your strength of mind  to
endeavour to correct them for me  jane  i don’t object to anything  i
should be quite broken-hearted if you thought of leaving    my mother
was too much overcome to go on 

 jane murdstone   said mr  murdstone to his sister   any harsh words
between us are  i hope  uncommon  it is not my fault that so unusual an
occurrence has taken place tonight  i was betrayed into it by another 
nor is it your fault  you were betrayed into it by another  let us both
try to forget it  and as this   he added  after these magnanimous words 
 is not a fit scene for the boy  david  go to bed  

i could hardly find the door  through the tears that stood in my eyes 
i was so sorry for my mother’s distress  but i groped my way out  and
groped my way up to my room in the dark  without even having the heart
to say good night to peggotty  or to get a candle from her  when her
coming up to look for me  an hour or so afterwards  awoke me  she said
that my mother had gone to bed poorly  and that mr  and miss murdstone
were sitting alone 

going down next morning rather earlier than usual  i paused outside the
parlour door  on hearing my mother’s voice  she was very earnestly and
humbly entreating miss murdstone’s pardon  which that lady granted  and
a perfect reconciliation took place  i never knew my mother afterwards
to give an opinion on any matter  without first appealing to miss
murdstone  or without having first ascertained by some sure means  what
miss murdstone’s opinion was  and i never saw miss murdstone  when out
of temper  she was infirm that way   move her hand towards her bag as
if she were going to take out the keys and offer to resign them to my
mother  without seeing that my mother was in a terrible fright 

the gloomy taint that was in the murdstone blood  darkened the murdstone
religion  which was austere and wrathful  i have thought  since 
that its assuming that character was a necessary consequence of mr 
murdstone’s firmness  which wouldn’t allow him to let anybody off from
the utmost weight of the severest penalties he could find any excuse
for  be this as it may  i well remember the tremendous visages with
which we used to go to church  and the changed air of the place  again 
the dreaded sunday comes round  and i file into the old pew first  like
a guarded captive brought to a condemned service  again  miss murdstone 
in a black velvet gown  that looks as if it had been made out of a pall 
follows close upon me  then my mother  then her husband  there is no
peggotty now  as in the old time  again  i listen to miss murdstone
mumbling the responses  and emphasizing all the dread words with a cruel
relish  again  i see her dark eyes roll round the church when she says
 miserable sinners   as if she were calling all the congregation names 
again  i catch rare glimpses of my mother  moving her lips timidly
between the two  with one of them muttering at each ear like low
thunder  again  i wonder with a sudden fear whether it is likely that
our good old clergyman can be wrong  and mr  and miss murdstone right 
and that all the angels in heaven can be destroying angels  again  if i
move a finger or relax a muscle of my face  miss murdstone pokes me with
her prayer-book  and makes my side ache 

yes  and again  as we walk home  i note some neighbours looking at my
mother and at me  and whispering  again  as the three go on arm-in-arm 
and i linger behind alone  i follow some of those looks  and wonder if
my mother’s step be really not so light as i have seen it  and if the
gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away  again  i wonder
whether any of the neighbours call to mind  as i do  how we used to
walk home together  she and i  and i wonder stupidly about that  all the
dreary dismal day 

there had been some talk on occasions of my going to boarding-school 
mr  and miss murdstone had originated it  and my mother had of course
agreed with them  nothing  however  was concluded on the subject yet 
in the meantime  i learnt lessons at home  shall i ever forget those
lessons  they were presided over nominally by my mother  but really by
mr  murdstone and his sister  who were always present  and found them
a favourable occasion for giving my mother lessons in that miscalled
firmness  which was the bane of both our lives  i believe i was kept
at home for that purpose  i had been apt enough to learn  and willing
enough  when my mother and i had lived alone together  i can faintly
remember learning the alphabet at her knee  to this day  when i look
upon the fat black letters in the primer  the puzzling novelty of their
shapes  and the easy good-nature of o and q and s  seem to present
themselves again before me as they used to do  but they recall no
feeling of disgust or reluctance  on the contrary  i seem to have walked
along a path of flowers as far as the crocodile-book  and to have been
cheered by the gentleness of my mother’s voice and manner all the
way  but these solemn lessons which succeeded those  i remember as the
death-blow of my peace  and a grievous daily drudgery and misery  they
were very long  very numerous  very hard  perfectly unintelligible 
some of them  to me  and i was generally as much bewildered by them as i
believe my poor mother was herself 

let me remember how it used to be  and bring one morning back again 

i come into the second-best parlour after breakfast  with my books 
and an exercise-book  and a slate  my mother is ready for me at her
writing-desk  but not half so ready as mr  murdstone in his easy-chair
by the window  though he pretends to be reading a book   or as miss
murdstone  sitting near my mother stringing steel beads  the very sight
of these two has such an influence over me  that i begin to feel the
words i have been at infinite pains to get into my head  all sliding
away  and going i don’t know where  i wonder where they do go  by the
by 

i hand the first book to my mother  perhaps it is a grammar  perhaps a
history  or geography  i take a last drowning look at the page as i give
it into her hand  and start off aloud at a racing pace while i have
got it fresh  i trip over a word  mr  murdstone looks up  i trip
over another word  miss murdstone looks up  i redden  tumble over
half-a-dozen words  and stop  i think my mother would show me the book
if she dared  but she does not dare  and she says softly 

 oh  davy  davy  

 now  clara   says mr  murdstone   be firm with the boy  don’t say   oh 
davy  davy   that’s childish  he knows his lesson  or he does not know
it  

 he does not know it   miss murdstone interposes awfully 

 i am really afraid he does not   says my mother 

 then  you see  clara   returns miss murdstone   you should just give
him the book back  and make him know it  

 yes  certainly   says my mother   that is what i intend to do  my dear
jane  now  davy  try once more  and don’t be stupid  

i obey the first clause of the injunction by trying once more  but am
not so successful with the second  for i am very stupid  i tumble down
before i get to the old place  at a point where i was all right before 
and stop to think  but i can’t think about the lesson  i think of the
number of yards of net in miss murdstone’s cap  or of the price of mr 
murdstone’s dressing-gown  or any such ridiculous problem that i have
no business with  and don’t want to have anything at all to do with  mr 
murdstone makes a movement of impatience which i have been expecting
for a long time  miss murdstone does the same  my mother glances
submissively at them  shuts the book  and lays it by as an arrear to be
worked out when my other tasks are done 

there is a pile of these arrears very soon  and it swells like a rolling
snowball  the bigger it gets  the more stupid i get  the case is so
hopeless  and i feel that i am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense  that
i give up all idea of getting out  and abandon myself to my fate  the
despairing way in which my mother and i look at each other  as i blunder
on  is truly melancholy  but the greatest effect in these miserable
lessons is when my mother  thinking nobody is observing her  tries
to give me the cue by the motion of her lips  at that instant  miss
murdstone  who has been lying in wait for nothing else all along  says
in a deep warning voice 

 clara  

my mother starts  colours  and smiles faintly  mr  murdstone comes out
of his chair  takes the book  throws it at me or boxes my ears with it 
and turns me out of the room by the shoulders 

even when the lessons are done  the worst is yet to happen  in the shape
of an appalling sum  this is invented for me  and delivered to me orally
by mr  murdstone  and begins   if i go into a cheesemonger’s shop  and
buy five thousand double-gloucester cheeses at fourpence-halfpenny each 
present payment   at which i see miss murdstone secretly overjoyed 
i pore over these cheeses without any result or enlightenment until
dinner-time  when  having made a mulatto of myself by getting the dirt
of the slate into the pores of my skin  i have a slice of bread to help
me out with the cheeses  and am considered in disgrace for the rest of
the evening 

it seems to me  at this distance of time  as if my unfortunate studies
generally took this course  i could have done very well if i had been
without the murdstones  but the influence of the murdstones upon me was
like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird  even when
i did get through the morning with tolerable credit  there was not
much gained but dinner  for miss murdstone never could endure to see me
untasked  and if i rashly made any show of being unemployed  called her
brother’s attention to me by saying   clara  my dear  there’s nothing
like work  give your boy an exercise   which caused me to be clapped
down to some new labour  there and then  as to any recreation with other
children of my age  i had very little of that  for the gloomy theology
of the murdstones made all children out to be a swarm of little vipers
 though there was a child once set in the midst of the disciples   and
held that they contaminated one another 

the natural result of this treatment  continued  i suppose  for some six
months or more  was to make me sullen  dull  and dogged  i was not
made the less so by my sense of being daily more and more shut out and
alienated from my mother  i believe i should have been almost stupefied
but for one circumstance 

it was this  my father had left a small collection of books in a little
room upstairs  to which i had access  for it adjoined my own  and which
nobody else in our house ever troubled  from that blessed little room 
roderick random  peregrine pickle  humphrey clinker  tom jones  the
vicar of wakefield  don quixote  gil blas  and robinson crusoe  came
out  a glorious host  to keep me company  they kept alive my fancy  and
my hope of something beyond that place and time   they  and the arabian
nights  and the tales of the genii   and did me no harm  for whatever
harm was in some of them was not there for me  i knew nothing of it  it
is astonishing to me now  how i found time  in the midst of my porings
and blunderings over heavier themes  to read those books as i did  it
is curious to me how i could ever have consoled myself under my
small troubles  which were great troubles to me   by impersonating my
favourite characters in them  as i did  and by putting mr  and miss
murdstone into all the bad ones  which i did too  i have been tom jones
 a child’s tom jones  a harmless creature  for a week together  i have
sustained my own idea of roderick random for a month at a stretch  i
verily believe  i had a greedy relish for a few volumes of voyages and
travels  i forget what  now  that were on those shelves  and for days
and days i can remember to have gone about my region of our house 
armed with the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees  the perfect
realization of captain somebody  of the royal british navy  in danger of
being beset by savages  and resolved to sell his life at a great price 
the captain never lost dignity  from having his ears boxed with the
latin grammar  i did  but the captain was a captain and a hero  in
despite of all the grammars of all the languages in the world  dead or
alive 

this was my only and my constant comfort  when i think of it  the
picture always rises in my mind  of a summer evening  the boys at play
in the churchyard  and i sitting on my bed  reading as if for life 
every barn in the neighbourhood  every stone in the church  and every
foot of the churchyard  had some association of its own  in my mind 
connected with these books  and stood for some locality made famous in
them  i have seen tom pipes go climbing up the church-steeple  i have
watched strap  with the knapsack on his back  stopping to rest himself
upon the wicket-gate  and i know that commodore trunnion held that club
with mr  pickle  in the parlour of our little village alehouse 

the reader now understands  as well as i do  what i was when i came to
that point of my youthful history to which i am now coming again 

one morning when i went into the parlour with my books  i found my
mother looking anxious  miss murdstone looking firm  and mr  murdstone
binding something round the bottom of a cane  a lithe and limber cane 
which he left off binding when i came in  and poised and switched in the
air 

 i tell you  clara   said mr  murdstone   i have been often flogged
myself  

 to be sure  of course   said miss murdstone 

 certainly  my dear jane   faltered my mother  meekly   but  but do you
think it did edward good  

 do you think it did edward harm  clara   asked mr  murdstone  gravely 

 that’s the point   said his sister 

to this my mother returned   certainly  my dear jane   and said no more 

i felt apprehensive that i was personally interested in this dialogue 
and sought mr  murdstone’s eye as it lighted on mine 

 now  david   he said  and i saw that cast again as he said it   you
must be far more careful today than usual   he gave the cane another
poise  and another switch  and having finished his preparation of it 
laid it down beside him  with an impressive look  and took up his book 

this was a good freshener to my presence of mind  as a beginning  i felt
the words of my lessons slipping off  not one by one  or line by line 
but by the entire page  i tried to lay hold of them  but they seemed 
if i may so express it  to have put skates on  and to skim away from me
with a smoothness there was no checking 

we began badly  and went on worse  i had come in with an idea of
distinguishing myself rather  conceiving that i was very well prepared 
but it turned out to be quite a mistake  book after book was added to
the heap of failures  miss murdstone being firmly watchful of us all the
time  and when we came at last to the five thousand cheeses  canes he
made it that day  i remember   my mother burst out crying 

 clara   said miss murdstone  in her warning voice 

 i am not quite well  my dear jane  i think   said my mother 

i saw him wink  solemnly  at his sister  as he rose and said  taking up
the cane 

 why  jane  we can hardly expect clara to bear  with perfect firmness 
the worry and torment that david has occasioned her today  that would be
stoical  clara is greatly strengthened and improved  but we can hardly
expect so much from her  david  you and i will go upstairs  boy  

as he took me out at the door  my mother ran towards us  miss murdstone
said   clara  are you a perfect fool   and interfered  i saw my mother
stop her ears then  and i heard her crying 

he walked me up to my room slowly and gravely  i am certain he had a
delight in that formal parade of executing justice  and when we got
there  suddenly twisted my head under his arm 

 mr  murdstone  sir   i cried to him   don’t  pray don’t beat me  i have
tried to learn  sir  but i can’t learn while you and miss murdstone are
by  i can’t indeed  

 can’t you  indeed  david   he said   we’ll try that  

he had my head as in a vice  but i twined round him somehow  and stopped
him for a moment  entreating him not to beat me  it was only a moment
that i stopped him  for he cut me heavily an instant afterwards  and in
the same instant i caught the hand with which he held me in my mouth 
between my teeth  and bit it through  it sets my teeth on edge to think
of it 

he beat me then  as if he would have beaten me to death  above all the
noise we made  i heard them running up the stairs  and crying out  i
heard my mother crying out  and peggotty  then he was gone  and the
door was locked outside  and i was lying  fevered and hot  and torn  and
sore  and raging in my puny way  upon the floor 

how well i recollect  when i became quiet  what an unnatural stillness
seemed to reign through the whole house  how well i remember  when my
smart and passion began to cool  how wicked i began to feel 

i sat listening for a long while  but there was not a sound  i crawled
up from the floor  and saw my face in the glass  so swollen  red  and
ugly that it almost frightened me  my stripes were sore and stiff  and
made me cry afresh  when i moved  but they were nothing to the guilt i
felt  it lay heavier on my breast than if i had been a most atrocious
criminal  i dare say 

it had begun to grow dark  and i had shut the window  i had been lying 
for the most part  with my head upon the sill  by turns crying  dozing 
and looking listlessly out   when the key was turned  and miss murdstone
came in with some bread and meat  and milk  these she put down upon the
table without a word  glaring at me the while with exemplary firmness 
and then retired  locking the door after her 

long after it was dark i sat there  wondering whether anybody else would
come  when this appeared improbable for that night  i undressed  and
went to bed  and  there  i began to wonder fearfully what would be done
to me  whether it was a criminal act that i had committed  whether i
should be taken into custody  and sent to prison  whether i was at all
in danger of being hanged 

i never shall forget the waking  next morning  the being cheerful and
fresh for the first moment  and then the being weighed down by the stale
and dismal oppression of remembrance  miss murdstone reappeared before
i was out of bed  told me  in so many words  that i was free to walk in
the garden for half an hour and no longer  and retired  leaving the door
open  that i might avail myself of that permission 

i did so  and did so every morning of my imprisonment  which lasted five
days  if i could have seen my mother alone  i should have gone down on
my knees to her and besought her forgiveness  but i saw no one  miss
murdstone excepted  during the whole time  except at evening prayers in
the parlour  to which i was escorted by miss murdstone after everybody
else was placed  where i was stationed  a young outlaw  all alone by
myself near the door  and whence i was solemnly conducted by my jailer 
before any one arose from the devotional posture  i only observed that
my mother was as far off from me as she could be  and kept her face
another way so that i never saw it  and that mr  murdstone’s hand was
bound up in a large linen wrapper 

the length of those five days i can convey no idea of to any one  they
occupy the place of years in my remembrance  the way in which i listened
to all the incidents of the house that made themselves audible to me 
the ringing of bells  the opening and shutting of doors  the murmuring
of voices  the footsteps on the stairs  to any laughing  whistling  or
singing  outside  which seemed more dismal than anything else to me in
my solitude and disgrace  the uncertain pace of the hours  especially
at night  when i would wake thinking it was morning  and find that the
family were not yet gone to bed  and that all the length of night had
yet to come  the depressed dreams and nightmares i had  the return of
day  noon  afternoon  evening  when the boys played in the churchyard 
and i watched them from a distance within the room  being ashamed to
show myself at the window lest they should know i was a prisoner  the
strange sensation of never hearing myself speak  the fleeting intervals
of something like cheerfulness  which came with eating and drinking 
and went away with it  the setting in of rain one evening  with a fresh
smell  and its coming down faster and faster between me and the church 
until it and gathering night seemed to quench me in gloom  and fear  and
remorse  all this appears to have gone round and round for years instead
of days  it is so vividly and strongly stamped on my remembrance  on the
last night of my restraint  i was awakened by hearing my own name spoken
in a whisper  i started up in bed  and putting out my arms in the dark 
said 

 is that you  peggotty  

there was no immediate answer  but presently i heard my name again  in a
tone so very mysterious and awful  that i think i should have gone into
a fit  if it had not occurred to me that it must have come through the
keyhole 

i groped my way to the door  and putting my own lips to the keyhole 
whispered   is that you  peggotty dear  

 yes  my own precious davy   she replied   be as soft as a mouse  or the
cat’ll hear us  

i understood this to mean miss murdstone  and was sensible of the
urgency of the case  her room being close by 

 how’s mama  dear peggotty  is she very angry with me  

i could hear peggotty crying softly on her side of the keyhole  as i was
doing on mine  before she answered   no  not very  

 what is going to be done with me  peggotty dear  do you know  

 school  near london   was peggotty’s answer  i was obliged to get her
to repeat it  for she spoke it the first time quite down my throat 
in consequence of my having forgotten to take my mouth away from the
keyhole and put my ear there  and though her words tickled me a good
deal  i didn’t hear them 

 when  peggotty  

 tomorrow  

 is that the reason why miss murdstone took the clothes out of my
drawers   which she had done  though i have forgotten to mention it 

 yes   said peggotty   box  

 shan’t i see mama  

 yes   said peggotty   morning  

then peggotty fitted her mouth close to the keyhole  and delivered these
words through it with as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole
has ever been the medium of communicating  i will venture to assert 
shooting in each broken little sentence in a convulsive little burst of
its own 

 davy  dear  if i ain’t been azackly as intimate with you  lately  as i
used to be  it ain’t because i don’t love you  just as well and more  my
pretty poppet  it’s because i thought it better for you  and for someone
else besides  davy  my darling  are you listening  can you hear  

 ye-ye-ye-yes  peggotty   i sobbed 

 my own   said peggotty  with infinite compassion   what i want to say 
is  that you must never forget me  for i’ll never forget you  and i’ll
take as much care of your mama  davy  as ever i took of you  and i won’t
leave her  the day may come when she’ll be glad to lay her poor head 
on her stupid  cross old peggotty’s arm again  and i’ll write to you 
my dear  though i ain’t no scholar  and i’ll  i’ll    peggotty fell to
kissing the keyhole  as she couldn’t kiss me 

 thank you  dear peggotty   said i   oh  thank you  thank you  will you
promise me one thing  peggotty  will you write and tell mr  peggotty and
little em’ly  and mrs  gummidge and ham  that i am not so bad as they
might suppose  and that i sent  em all my love  especially to little
em’ly  will you  if you please  peggotty  

the kind soul promised  and we both of us kissed the keyhole with the
greatest affection  i patted it with my hand  i recollect  as if it had
been her honest face  and parted  from that night there grew up in my
breast a feeling for peggotty which i cannot very well define  she did
not replace my mother  no one could do that  but she came into a vacancy
in my heart  which closed upon her  and i felt towards her something
i have never felt for any other human being  it was a sort of comical
affection  too  and yet if she had died  i cannot think what i should
have done  or how i should have acted out the tragedy it would have been
to me 

in the morning miss murdstone appeared as usual  and told me i was going
to school  which was not altogether such news to me as she supposed  she
also informed me that when i was dressed  i was to come downstairs into
the parlour  and have my breakfast  there  i found my mother  very pale
and with red eyes  into whose arms i ran  and begged her pardon from my
suffering soul 

 oh  davy   she said   that you could hurt anyone i love  try to be
better  pray to be better  i forgive you  but i am so grieved  davy 
that you should have such bad passions in your heart  

they had persuaded her that i was a wicked fellow  and she was more
sorry for that than for my going away  i felt it sorely  i tried to eat
my parting breakfast  but my tears dropped upon my bread-and-butter 
and trickled into my tea  i saw my mother look at me sometimes  and then
glance at the watchful miss murdstone  and than look down  or look away 

 master copperfield’s box there   said miss murdstone  when wheels were
heard at the gate 

i looked for peggotty  but it was not she  neither she nor mr  murdstone
appeared  my former acquaintance  the carrier  was at the door  the box
was taken out to his cart  and lifted in 

 clara   said miss murdstone  in her warning note 

 ready  my dear jane   returned my mother   good-bye  davy  you are
going for your own good  good-bye  my child  you will come home in the
holidays  and be a better boy  

 clara   miss murdstone repeated 

 certainly  my dear jane   replied my mother  who was holding me   i
forgive you  my dear boy  god bless you  

 clara   miss murdstone repeated 

miss murdstone was good enough to take me out to the cart  and to say on
the way that she hoped i would repent  before i came to a bad end  and
then i got into the cart  and the lazy horse walked off with it 



chapter 5  i am sent away from home


we might have gone about half a mile  and my pocket-handkerchief was
quite wet through  when the carrier stopped short  looking out to
ascertain for what  i saw  to my amazement  peggotty burst from a hedge
and climb into the cart  she took me in both her arms  and squeezed me
to her stays until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful  though
i never thought of that till afterwards when i found it very tender  not
a single word did peggotty speak  releasing one of her arms  she put
it down in her pocket to the elbow  and brought out some paper bags of
cakes which she crammed into my pockets  and a purse which she put into
my hand  but not one word did she say  after another and a final squeeze
with both arms  she got down from the cart and ran away  and  my belief
is  and has always been  without a solitary button on her gown  i
picked up one  of several that were rolling about  and treasured it as a
keepsake for a long time 

the carrier looked at me  as if to inquire if she were coming back  i
shook my head  and said i thought not   then come up   said the carrier
to the lazy horse  who came up accordingly 

having by this time cried as much as i possibly could  i began to think
it was of no use crying any more  especially as neither roderick random 
nor that captain in the royal british navy  had ever cried  that i
could remember  in trying situations  the carrier  seeing me in this
resolution  proposed that my pocket-handkerchief should be spread upon
the horse’s back to dry  i thanked him  and assented  and particularly
small it looked  under those circumstances 

i had now leisure to examine the purse  it was a stiff leather purse 
with a snap  and had three bright shillings in it  which peggotty had
evidently polished up with whitening  for my greater delight  but its
most precious contents were two half-crowns folded together in a bit
of paper  on which was written  in my mother’s hand   for davy  with my
love   i was so overcome by this  that i asked the carrier to be so good
as to reach me my pocket-handkerchief again  but he said he thought i
had better do without it  and i thought i really had  so i wiped my eyes
on my sleeve and stopped myself 

for good  too  though  in consequence of my previous emotions  i was
still occasionally seized with a stormy sob  after we had jogged on for
some little time  i asked the carrier if he was going all the way 

 all the way where   inquired the carrier 

 there   i said 

 where’s there   inquired the carrier 

 near london   i said 

 why that horse   said the carrier  jerking the rein to point him out 
 would be deader than pork afore he got over half the ground  

 are you only going to yarmouth then   i asked 

 that’s about it   said the carrier   and there i shall take you to the
stage-cutch  and the stage-cutch that’ll take you to  wherever it is  

as this was a great deal for the carrier  whose name was mr  barkis 
to say  he being  as i observed in a former chapter  of a phlegmatic
temperament  and not at all conversational  i offered him a cake as a
mark of attention  which he ate at one gulp  exactly like an elephant 
and which made no more impression on his big face than it would have
done on an elephant’s 

 did she make  em  now   said mr  barkis  always leaning forward  in his
slouching way  on the footboard of the cart with an arm on each knee 

 peggotty  do you mean  sir  

 ah   said mr  barkis   her  

 yes  she makes all our pastry  and does all our cooking  

 do she though   said mr  barkis  he made up his mouth as if to whistle 
but he didn’t whistle  he sat looking at the horse’s ears  as if he saw
something new there  and sat so  for a considerable time  by and by  he
said 

 no sweethearts  i b’lieve  

 sweetmeats did you say  mr  barkis   for i thought he wanted
something else to eat  and had pointedly alluded to that description of
refreshment 

 hearts   said mr  barkis   sweet hearts  no person walks with her  

 with peggotty  

 ah   he said   her  

 oh  no  she never had a sweetheart  

 didn’t she  though   said mr  barkis 

again he made up his mouth to whistle  and again he didn’t whistle  but
sat looking at the horse’s ears 

 so she makes   said mr  barkis  after a long interval of reflection 
 all the apple parsties  and doos all the cooking  do she  

i replied that such was the fact 

 well  i’ll tell you what   said mr  barkis   p’raps you might be
writin  to her  

 i shall certainly write to her   i rejoined 

 ah   he said  slowly turning his eyes towards me   well  if you was
writin  to her  p’raps you’d recollect to say that barkis was willin  
would you  

 that barkis is willing   i repeated  innocently   is that all the
message  

 ye-es   he said  considering   ye-es  barkis is willin   

 but you will be at blunderstone again tomorrow  mr  barkis   i said 
faltering a little at the idea of my being far away from it then  and
could give your own message so much better  

as he repudiated this suggestion  however  with a jerk of his head 
and once more confirmed his previous request by saying  with profound
gravity   barkis is willin   that’s the message   i readily undertook
its transmission  while i was waiting for the coach in the hotel
at yarmouth that very afternoon  i procured a sheet of paper and
an inkstand  and wrote a note to peggotty  which ran thus   my dear
peggotty  i have come here safe  barkis is willing  my love to mama 
yours affectionately  p.s  he says he particularly wants you to
know  barkis is willing  

when i had taken this commission on myself prospectively  mr  barkis
relapsed into perfect silence  and i  feeling quite worn out by all that
had happened lately  lay down on a sack in the cart and fell asleep  i
slept soundly until we got to yarmouth  which was so entirely new
and strange to me in the inn-yard to which we drove  that i at once
abandoned a latent hope i had had of meeting with some of mr  peggotty’s
family there  perhaps even with little em’ly herself 

the coach was in the yard  shining very much all over  but without any
horses to it as yet  and it looked in that state as if nothing was
more unlikely than its ever going to london  i was thinking this  and
wondering what would ultimately become of my box  which mr  barkis had
put down on the yard-pavement by the pole  he having driven up the yard
to turn his cart   and also what would ultimately become of me  when a
lady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were
hanging up  and said 

 is that the little gentleman from blunderstone  

 yes  ma’am   i said 

 what name   inquired the lady 

 copperfield  ma’am   i said 

 that won’t do   returned the lady   nobody’s dinner is paid for here 
in that name  

 is it murdstone  ma’am   i said 

 if you’re master murdstone   said the lady   why do you go and give
another name  first  

i explained to the lady how it was  who than rang a bell  and called
out   william  show the coffee-room   upon which a waiter came running
out of a kitchen on the opposite side of the yard to show it  and seemed
a good deal surprised when he was only to show it to me 

it was a large long room with some large maps in it  i doubt if i could
have felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries  and
i cast away in the middle of them  i felt it was taking a liberty to
sit down  with my cap in my hand  on the corner of the chair nearest the
door  and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me  and put a set
of castors on it  i think i must have turned red all over with modesty 

he brought me some chops  and vegetables  and took the covers off in
such a bouncing manner that i was afraid i must have given him some
offence  but he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at
the table  and saying  very affably   now  six-foot  come on  

i thanked him  and took my seat at the board  but found it extremely
difficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity 
or to avoid splashing myself with the gravy  while he was standing
opposite  staring so hard  and making me blush in the most dreadful
manner every time i caught his eye  after watching me into the second
chop  he said 

 there’s half a pint of ale for you  will you have it now  

i thanked him and said   yes   upon which he poured it out of a jug
into a large tumbler  and held it up against the light  and made it look
beautiful 

 my eye   he said   it seems a good deal  don’t it  

 it does seem a good deal   i answered with a smile  for it was quite
delightful to me  to find him so pleasant  he was a twinkling-eyed 
pimple-faced man  with his hair standing upright all over his head  and
as he stood with one arm a-kimbo  holding up the glass to the light with
the other hand  he looked quite friendly 

 there was a gentleman here  yesterday   he said   a stout gentleman  by
the name of topsawyer  perhaps you know him  

 no   i said   i don’t think   

 in breeches and gaiters  broad-brimmed hat  grey coat  speckled
choker   said the waiter 

 no   i said bashfully   i haven’t the pleasure   

 he came in here   said the waiter  looking at the light through the
tumbler   ordered a glass of this ale  would order it  i told him
not  drank it  and fell dead  it was too old for him  it oughtn’t to be
drawn  that’s the fact  

i was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident  and said i
thought i had better have some water 

 why you see   said the waiter  still looking at the light through the
tumbler  with one of his eyes shut up   our people don’t like things
being ordered and left  it offends  em  but i’ll drink it  if you like 
i’m used to it  and use is everything  i don’t think it’ll hurt me  if i
throw my head back  and take it off quick  shall i  

i replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it  if he thought
he could do it safely  but by no means otherwise  when he did throw his
head back  and take it off quick  i had a horrible fear  i confess 
of seeing him meet the fate of the lamented mr  topsawyer  and fall
lifeless on the carpet  but it didn’t hurt him  on the contrary  i
thought he seemed the fresher for it 

 what have we got here   he said  putting a fork into my dish   not
chops  

 chops   i said 

 lord bless my soul   he exclaimed   i didn’t know they were chops  why 
a chop’s the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer  ain’t
it lucky  

so he took a chop by the bone in one hand  and a potato in the other 
and ate away with a very good appetite  to my extreme satisfaction 
he afterwards took another chop  and another potato  and after that 
another chop and another potato  when we had done  he brought me a
pudding  and having set it before me  seemed to ruminate  and to become
absent in his mind for some moments 

 how’s the pie   he said  rousing himself 

 it’s a pudding   i made answer 

 pudding   he exclaimed   why  bless me  so it is  what   looking at it
nearer   you don’t mean to say it’s a batter-pudding  

 yes  it is indeed  

 why  a batter-pudding   he said  taking up a table-spoon   is my
favourite pudding  ain’t that lucky  come on  little  un  and let’s see
who’ll get most  

the waiter certainly got most  he entreated me more than once to come in
and win  but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon  his dispatch to
my dispatch  and his appetite to my appetite  i was left far behind at
the first mouthful  and had no chance with him  i never saw anyone enjoy
a pudding so much  i think  and he laughed  when it was all gone  as if
his enjoyment of it lasted still 

finding him so very friendly and companionable  it was then that i asked
for the pen and ink and paper  to write to peggotty  he not only brought
it immediately  but was good enough to look over me while i wrote the
letter  when i had finished it  he asked me where i was going to school 

i said   near london   which was all i knew 

 oh  my eye   he said  looking very low-spirited   i am sorry for that  

 why   i asked him 

 oh  lord   he said  shaking his head   that’s the school where they
broke the boy’s ribs  two ribs  a little boy he was  i should say he
was  let me see  how old are you  about  

i told him between eight and nine 

 that’s just his age   he said   he was eight years and six months old
when they broke his first rib  eight years and eight months old when
they broke his second  and did for him  

i could not disguise from myself  or from the waiter  that this was an
uncomfortable coincidence  and inquired how it was done  his answer was
not cheering to my spirits  for it consisted of two dismal words   with
whopping  

the blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion 
which made me get up and hesitatingly inquire  in the mingled pride and
diffidence of having a purse  which i took out of my pocket   if there
were anything to pay 

 there’s a sheet of letter-paper   he returned   did you ever buy a
sheet of letter-paper  

i could not remember that i ever had 

 it’s dear   he said   on account of the duty  threepence  that’s
the way we’re taxed in this country  there’s nothing else  except the
waiter  never mind the ink  i lose by that  

 what should you  what should i  how much ought i to  what would it be
right to pay the waiter  if you please   i stammered  blushing 

 if i hadn’t a family  and that family hadn’t the cowpock   said the
waiter   i wouldn’t take a sixpence  if i didn’t support a aged pairint 
and a lovely sister    here the waiter was greatly agitated   i wouldn’t
take a farthing  if i had a good place  and was treated well here  i
should beg acceptance of a trifle  instead of taking of it  but i live
on broken wittles  and i sleep on the coals   here the waiter burst into
tears 

i was very much concerned for his misfortunes  and felt that any
recognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of
heart  therefore i gave him one of my three bright shillings  which he
received with much humility and veneration  and spun up with his thumb 
directly afterwards  to try the goodness of 

it was a little disconcerting to me  to find  when i was being helped
up behind the coach  that i was supposed to have eaten all the dinner
without any assistance  i discovered this  from overhearing the lady in
the bow-window say to the guard   take care of that child  george  or
he’ll burst   and from observing that the women-servants who were about
the place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon  my
unfortunate friend the waiter  who had quite recovered his spirits  did
not appear to be disturbed by this  but joined in the general admiration
without being at all confused  if i had any doubt of him  i suppose
this half awakened it  but i am inclined to believe that with the simple
confidence of a child  and the natural reliance of a child upon superior
years  qualities i am very sorry any children should prematurely change
for worldly wisdom   i had no serious mistrust of him on the whole  even
then 

i felt it rather hard  i must own  to be made  without deserving it  the
subject of jokes between the coachman and guard as to the coach drawing
heavy behind  on account of my sitting there  and as to the greater
expediency of my travelling by waggon  the story of my supposed appetite
getting wind among the outside passengers  they were merry upon it
likewise  and asked me whether i was going to be paid for  at school 
as two brothers or three  and whether i was contracted for  or went upon
the regular terms  with other pleasant questions  but the worst of
it was  that i knew i should be ashamed to eat anything  when an
opportunity offered  and that  after a rather light dinner  i should
remain hungry all night  for i had left my cakes behind  at the hotel 
in my hurry  my apprehensions were realized  when we stopped for supper
i couldn’t muster courage to take any  though i should have liked it
very much  but sat by the fire and said i didn’t want anything  this did
not save me from more jokes  either  for a husky-voiced gentleman with
a rough face  who had been eating out of a sandwich-box nearly all the
way  except when he had been drinking out of a bottle  said i was like
a boa-constrictor who took enough at one meal to last him a long time 
after which  he actually brought a rash out upon himself with boiled
beef 

we had started from yarmouth at three o’clock in the afternoon  and we
were due in london about eight next morning  it was mid-summer weather 
and the evening was very pleasant  when we passed through a village  i
pictured to myself what the insides of the houses were like  and what
the inhabitants were about  and when boys came running after us  and
got up behind and swung there for a little way  i wondered whether their
fathers were alive  and whether they were happy at home  i had plenty to
think of  therefore  besides my mind running continually on the kind
of place i was going to  which was an awful speculation  sometimes  i
remember  i resigned myself to thoughts of home and peggotty  and to
endeavouring  in a confused blind way  to recall how i had felt  and
what sort of boy i used to be  before i bit mr  murdstone  which i
couldn’t satisfy myself about by any means  i seemed to have bitten him
in such a remote antiquity 

the night was not so pleasant as the evening  for it got chilly  and
being put between two gentlemen  the rough-faced one and another  to
prevent my tumbling off the coach  i was nearly smothered by their
falling asleep  and completely blocking me up  they squeezed me so hard
sometimes  that i could not help crying out   oh  if you please    which
they didn’t like at all  because it woke them  opposite me was an
elderly lady in a great fur cloak  who looked in the dark more like a
haystack than a lady  she was wrapped up to such a degree  this lady had
a basket with her  and she hadn’t known what to do with it  for a long
time  until she found that on account of my legs being short  it could
go underneath me  it cramped and hurt me so  that it made me perfectly
miserable  but if i moved in the least  and made a glass that was in the
basket rattle against something else  as it was sure to do   she gave
me the cruellest poke with her foot  and said   come  don’t you fidget 
your bones are young enough  i’m sure  

at last the sun rose  and then my companions seemed to sleep easier 
the difficulties under which they had laboured all night  and which had
found utterance in the most terrific gasps and snorts  are not to be
conceived  as the sun got higher  their sleep became lighter  and so
they gradually one by one awoke  i recollect being very much surprised
by the feint everybody made  then  of not having been to sleep at all 
and by the uncommon indignation with which everyone repelled the
charge  i labour under the same kind of astonishment to this day  having
invariably observed that of all human weaknesses  the one to which our
common nature is the least disposed to confess  i cannot imagine why  is
the weakness of having gone to sleep in a coach 

what an amazing place london was to me when i saw it in the distance 
and how i believed all the adventures of all my favourite heroes to be
constantly enacting and re-enacting there  and how i vaguely made it
out in my own mind to be fuller of wonders and wickedness than all the
cities of the earth  i need not stop here to relate  we approached it by
degrees  and got  in due time  to the inn in the whitechapel district 
for which we were bound  i forget whether it was the blue bull  or the
blue boar  but i know it was the blue something  and that its likeness
was painted up on the back of the coach 

the guard’s eye lighted on me as he was getting down  and he said at the
booking-office door 

 is there anybody here for a yoongster booked in the name of murdstone 
from bloonderstone  sooffolk  to be left till called for  

nobody answered 

 try copperfield  if you please  sir   said i  looking helplessly down 

 is there anybody here for a yoongster  booked in the name of murdstone 
from bloonderstone  sooffolk  but owning to the name of copperfield  to
be left till called for   said the guard   come  is there anybody  

no  there was nobody  i looked anxiously around  but the inquiry made no
impression on any of the bystanders  if i except a man in gaiters  with
one eye  who suggested that they had better put a brass collar round my
neck  and tie me up in the stable 

a ladder was brought  and i got down after the lady  who was like a
haystack  not daring to stir  until her basket was removed  the coach
was clear of passengers by that time  the luggage was very soon cleared
out  the horses had been taken out before the luggage  and now the coach
itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers  out of the way 
still  nobody appeared  to claim the dusty youngster from blunderstone 
suffolk 

more solitary than robinson crusoe  who had nobody to look at him
and see that he was solitary  i went into the booking-office  and  by
invitation of the clerk on duty  passed behind the counter  and sat down
on the scale at which they weighed the luggage  here  as i sat looking
at the parcels  packages  and books  and inhaling the smell of stables
 ever since associated with that morning   a procession of most
tremendous considerations began to march through my mind  supposing
nobody should ever fetch me  how long would they consent to keep me
there  would they keep me long enough to spend seven shillings  should i
sleep at night in one of those wooden bins  with the other luggage 
and wash myself at the pump in the yard in the morning  or should i
be turned out every night  and expected to come again to be left till
called for  when the office opened next day  supposing there was no
mistake in the case  and mr  murdstone had devised this plan to get rid
of me  what should i do  if they allowed me to remain there until my
seven shillings were spent  i couldn’t hope to remain there when i began
to starve  that would obviously be inconvenient and unpleasant to the
customers  besides entailing on the blue whatever-it-was  the risk of
funeral expenses  if i started off at once  and tried to walk back home 
how could i ever find my way  how could i ever hope to walk so far  how
could i make sure of anyone but peggotty  even if i got back  if i
found out the nearest proper authorities  and offered myself to go for a
soldier  or a sailor  i was such a little fellow that it was most likely
they wouldn’t take me in  these thoughts  and a hundred other such
thoughts  turned me burning hot  and made me giddy with apprehension and
dismay  i was in the height of my fever when a man entered and whispered
to the clerk  who presently slanted me off the scale  and pushed me over
to him  as if i were weighed  bought  delivered  and paid for 

as i went out of the office  hand in hand with this new acquaintance 
i stole a look at him  he was a gaunt  sallow young man  with hollow
cheeks  and a chin almost as black as mr  murdstone’s  but there the
likeness ended  for his whiskers were shaved off  and his hair  instead
of being glossy  was rusty and dry  he was dressed in a suit of black
clothes which were rather rusty and dry too  and rather short in the
sleeves and legs  and he had a white neck-kerchief on  that was not
over-clean  i did not  and do not  suppose that this neck-kerchief was
all the linen he wore  but it was all he showed or gave any hint of 

 you’re the new boy   he said   yes  sir   i said 

i supposed i was  i didn’t know 

 i’m one of the masters at salem house   he said 

i made him a bow and felt very much overawed  i was so ashamed to allude
to a commonplace thing like my box  to a scholar and a master at salem
house  that we had gone some little distance from the yard before i had
the hardihood to mention it  we turned back  on my humbly insinuating
that it might be useful to me hereafter  and he told the clerk that the
carrier had instructions to call for it at noon 

 if you please  sir   i said  when we had accomplished about the same
distance as before   is it far  

 it’s down by blackheath   he said 

 is that far  sir   i diffidently asked 

 it’s a good step   he said   we shall go by the stage-coach  it’s about
six miles  

i was so faint and tired  that the idea of holding out for six miles
more  was too much for me  i took heart to tell him that i had had
nothing all night  and that if he would allow me to buy something to
eat  i should be very much obliged to him  he appeared surprised at
this  i see him stop and look at me now  and after considering for a few
moments  said he wanted to call on an old person who lived not far off 
and that the best way would be for me to buy some bread  or whatever i
liked best that was wholesome  and make my breakfast at her house  where
we could get some milk 

accordingly we looked in at a baker’s window  and after i had made a
series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop  and
he had rejected them one by one  we decided in favour of a nice little
loaf of brown bread  which cost me threepence  then  at a grocer’s shop 
we bought an egg and a slice of streaky bacon  which still left what
i thought a good deal of change  out of the second of the bright
shillings  and made me consider london a very cheap place  these
provisions laid in  we went on through a great noise and uproar that
confused my weary head beyond description  and over a bridge which  no
doubt  was london bridge  indeed i think he told me so  but i was half
asleep   until we came to the poor person’s house  which was a part of
some alms-houses  as i knew by their look  and by an inscription on a
stone over the gate which said they were established for twenty-five
poor women 

the master at salem house lifted the latch of one of a number of little
black doors that were all alike  and had each a little diamond-paned
window on one side  and another little diamond  paned window above  and
we went into the little house of one of these poor old women  who was
blowing a fire to make a little saucepan boil  on seeing the master
enter  the old woman stopped with the bellows on her knee  and said
something that i thought sounded like  my charley   but on seeing me
come in too  she got up  and rubbing her hands made a confused sort of
half curtsey 

 can you cook this young gentleman’s breakfast for him  if you please  
said the master at salem house 

 can i   said the old woman   yes can i  sure  

 how’s mrs  fibbitson today   said the master  looking at another old
woman in a large chair by the fire  who was such a bundle of clothes
that i feel grateful to this hour for not having sat upon her by
mistake 

 ah  she’s poorly   said the first old woman   it’s one of her bad days 
if the fire was to go out  through any accident  i verily believe she’d
go out too  and never come to life again  

as they looked at her  i looked at her also  although it was a warm day 
she seemed to think of nothing but the fire  i fancied she was jealous
even of the saucepan on it  and i have reason to know that she took its
impressment into the service of boiling my egg and broiling my bacon  in
dudgeon  for i saw her  with my own discomfited eyes  shake her fist at
me once  when those culinary operations were going on  and no one else
was looking  the sun streamed in at the little window  but she sat with
her own back and the back of the large chair towards it  screening the
fire as if she were sedulously keeping it warm  instead of it keeping
her warm  and watching it in a most distrustful manner  the completion
of the preparations for my breakfast  by relieving the fire  gave her
such extreme joy that she laughed aloud  and a very unmelodious laugh
she had  i must say 

i sat down to my brown loaf  my egg  and my rasher of bacon  with a
basin of milk besides  and made a most delicious meal  while i was yet
in the full enjoyment of it  the old woman of the house said to the
master 

 have you got your flute with you  

 yes   he returned 

 have a blow at it   said the old woman  coaxingly   do  

the master  upon this  put his hand underneath the skirts of his coat 
and brought out his flute in three pieces  which he screwed together 
and began immediately to play  my impression is  after many years of
consideration  that there never can have been anybody in the world who
played worse  he made the most dismal sounds i have ever heard produced
by any means  natural or artificial  i don’t know what the tunes
were  if there were such things in the performance at all  which i
doubt  but the influence of the strain upon me was  first  to make me
think of all my sorrows until i could hardly keep my tears back  then to
take away my appetite  and lastly  to make me so sleepy that i couldn’t
keep my eyes open  they begin to close again  and i begin to nod  as the
recollection rises fresh upon me  once more the little room  with its
open corner cupboard  and its square-backed chairs  and its angular
little staircase leading to the room above  and its three peacock’s
feathers displayed over the mantelpiece  i remember wondering when i
first went in  what that peacock would have thought if he had known what
his finery was doomed to come to  fades from before me  and i nod  and
sleep  the flute becomes inaudible  the wheels of the coach are heard
instead  and i am on my journey  the coach jolts  i wake with a start 
and the flute has come back again  and the master at salem house is
sitting with his legs crossed  playing it dolefully  while the old woman
of the house looks on delighted  she fades in her turn  and he fades 
and all fades  and there is no flute  no master  no salem house  no
david copperfield  no anything but heavy sleep 

i dreamed  i thought  that once while he was blowing into this dismal
flute  the old woman of the house  who had gone nearer and nearer to him
in her ecstatic admiration  leaned over the back of his chair and gave
him an affectionate squeeze round the neck  which stopped his playing
for a moment  i was in the middle state between sleeping and waking 
either then or immediately afterwards  for  as he resumed  it was a real
fact that he had stopped playing  i saw and heard the same old woman ask
mrs  fibbitson if it wasn’t delicious  meaning the flute   to which mrs 
fibbitson replied   ay  ay  yes   and nodded at the fire  to which  i am
persuaded  she gave the credit of the whole performance 

when i seemed to have been dozing a long while  the master at salem
house unscrewed his flute into the three pieces  put them up as before 
and took me away  we found the coach very near at hand  and got upon the
roof  but i was so dead sleepy  that when we stopped on the road to take
up somebody else  they put me inside where there were no passengers  and
where i slept profoundly  until i found the coach going at a footpace up
a steep hill among green leaves  presently  it stopped  and had come to
its destination 

a short walk brought us  i mean the master and me  to salem house  which
was enclosed with a high brick wall  and looked very dull  over a door
in this wall was a board with salem house upon it  and through a grating
in this door we were surveyed when we rang the bell by a surly face 
which i found  on the door being opened  belonged to a stout man with a
bull-neck  a wooden leg  overhanging temples  and his hair cut close all
round his head 

 the new boy   said the master 

the man with the wooden leg eyed me all over  it didn’t take long  for
there was not much of me  and locked the gate behind us  and took out
the key  we were going up to the house  among some dark heavy trees 
when he called after my conductor   hallo  

we looked back  and he was standing at the door of a little lodge  where
he lived  with a pair of boots in his hand 

 here  the cobbler’s been   he said   since you’ve been out  mr  mell 
and he says he can’t mend  em any more  he says there ain’t a bit of the
original boot left  and he wonders you expect it  

with these words he threw the boots towards mr  mell  who went back a
few paces to pick them up  and looked at them  very disconsolately 
i was afraid   as we went on together  i observed then  for the first
time  that the boots he had on were a good deal the worse for wear  and
that his stocking was just breaking out in one place  like a bud 

salem house was a square brick building with wings  of a bare and
unfurnished appearance  all about it was so very quiet  that i said to
mr  mell i supposed the boys were out  but he seemed surprised at my
not knowing that it was holiday-time  that all the boys were at their
several homes  that mr  creakle  the proprietor  was down by the
sea-side with mrs  and miss creakle  and that i was sent in holiday-time
as a punishment for my misdoing  all of which he explained to me as we
went along 

i gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took me  as the most forlorn
and desolate place i had ever seen  i see it now  a long room with three
long rows of desks  and six of forms  and bristling all round with pegs
for hats and slates  scraps of old copy-books and exercises litter the
dirty floor  some silkworms  houses  made of the same materials  are
scattered over the desks  two miserable little white mice  left behind
by their owner  are running up and down in a fusty castle made of
pasteboard and wire  looking in all the corners with their red eyes
for anything to eat  a bird  in a cage very little bigger than himself 
makes a mournful rattle now and then in hopping on his perch  two inches
high  or dropping from it  but neither sings nor chirps  there is a
strange unwholesome smell upon the room  like mildewed corduroys  sweet
apples wanting air  and rotten books  there could not well be more ink
splashed about it  if it had been roofless from its first construction 
and the skies had rained  snowed  hailed  and blown ink through the
varying seasons of the year 

mr  mell having left me while he took his irreparable boots upstairs  i
went softly to the upper end of the room  observing all this as i crept
along  suddenly i came upon a pasteboard placard  beautifully written 
which was lying on the desk  and bore these words   take care of him  he
bites  

i got upon the desk immediately  apprehensive of at least a great dog
underneath  but  though i looked all round with anxious eyes  i could
see nothing of him  i was still engaged in peering about  when mr  mell
came back  and asked me what i did up there 

 i beg your pardon  sir   says i   if you please  i’m looking for the
dog  

 dog   he says   what dog  

 isn’t it a dog  sir  

 isn’t what a dog  

 that’s to be taken care of  sir  that bites  

 no  copperfield   says he  gravely   that’s not a dog  that’s a boy 
my instructions are  copperfield  to put this placard on your back  i am
sorry to make such a beginning with you  but i must do it   with that he
took me down  and tied the placard  which was neatly constructed for
the purpose  on my shoulders like a knapsack  and wherever i went 
afterwards  i had the consolation of carrying it 

what i suffered from that placard  nobody can imagine  whether it was
possible for people to see me or not  i always fancied that somebody was
reading it  it was no relief to turn round and find nobody  for wherever
my back was  there i imagined somebody always to be  that cruel man with
the wooden leg aggravated my sufferings  he was in authority  and if he
ever saw me leaning against a tree  or a wall  or the house  he roared
out from his lodge door in a stupendous voice   hallo  you sir  you
copperfield  show that badge conspicuous  or i’ll report you   the
playground was a bare gravelled yard  open to all the back of the house
and the offices  and i knew that the servants read it  and the butcher
read it  and the baker read it  that everybody  in a word  who came
backwards and forwards to the house  of a morning when i was ordered to
walk there  read that i was to be taken care of  for i bit  i recollect
that i positively began to have a dread of myself  as a kind of wild boy
who did bite 

there was an old door in this playground  on which the boys had a
custom of carving their names  it was completely covered with such
inscriptions  in my dread of the end of the vacation and their coming
back  i could not read a boy’s name  without inquiring in what tone and
with what emphasis he would read   take care of him  he bites   there
was one boy  a certain j  steerforth  who cut his name very deep and
very often  who  i conceived  would read it in a rather strong voice 
and afterwards pull my hair  there was another boy  one tommy traddles 
who i dreaded would make game of it  and pretend to be dreadfully
frightened of me  there was a third  george demple  who i fancied would
sing it  i have looked  a little shrinking creature  at that door  until
the owners of all the names  there were five-and-forty of them in the
school then  mr  mell said  seemed to send me to coventry by general
acclamation  and to cry out  each in his own way   take care of him  he
bites  

it was the same with the places at the desks and forms  it was the same
with the groves of deserted bedsteads i peeped at  on my way to  and
when i was in  my own bed  i remember dreaming night after night  of
being with my mother as she used to be  or of going to a party at mr 
peggotty’s  or of travelling outside the stage-coach  or of dining again
with my unfortunate friend the waiter  and in all these circumstances
making people scream and stare  by the unhappy disclosure that i had
nothing on but my little night-shirt  and that placard 

in the monotony of my life  and in my constant apprehension of the
re-opening of the school  it was such an insupportable affliction  i had
long tasks every day to do with mr  mell  but i did them  there being
no mr  and miss murdstone here  and got through them without disgrace 
before  and after them  i walked about  supervised  as i have mentioned 
by the man with the wooden leg  how vividly i call to mind the damp
about the house  the green cracked flagstones in the court  an old leaky
water-butt  and the discoloured trunks of some of the grim trees  which
seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees  and to have
blown less in the sun  at one we dined  mr  mell and i  at the upper end
of a long bare dining-room  full of deal tables  and smelling of fat 
then  we had more tasks until tea  which mr  mell drank out of a blue
teacup  and i out of a tin pot  all day long  and until seven or eight
in the evening  mr  mell  at his own detached desk in the schoolroom 
worked hard with pen  ink  ruler  books  and writing-paper  making out
the bills  as i found  for last half-year  when he had put up his things
for the night he took out his flute  and blew at it  until i almost
thought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole at
the top  and ooze away at the keys 

i picture my small self in the dimly-lighted rooms  sitting with my
head upon my hand  listening to the doleful performance of mr  mell 
and conning tomorrow’s lessons  i picture myself with my books shut up 
still listening to the doleful performance of mr  mell  and listening
through it to what used to be at home  and to the blowing of the wind
on yarmouth flats  and feeling very sad and solitary  i picture myself
going up to bed  among the unused rooms  and sitting on my bed-side
crying for a comfortable word from peggotty  i picture myself coming
downstairs in the morning  and looking through a long ghastly gash of a
staircase window at the school-bell hanging on the top of an out-house
with a weathercock above it  and dreading the time when it shall ring j 
steerforth and the rest to work  which is only second  in my foreboding
apprehensions  to the time when the man with the wooden leg shall unlock
the rusty gate to give admission to the awful mr  creakle  i cannot
think i was a very dangerous character in any of these aspects  but in
all of them i carried the same warning on my back 

mr  mell never said much to me  but he was never harsh to me  i suppose
we were company to each other  without talking  i forgot to mention that
he would talk to himself sometimes  and grin  and clench his fist  and
grind his teeth  and pull his hair in an unaccountable manner  but he
had these peculiarities  and at first they frightened me  though i soon
got used to them 



chapter 6  i enlarge my circle of acquaintance


i had led this life about a month  when the man with the wooden leg
began to stump about with a mop and a bucket of water  from which i
inferred that preparations were making to receive mr  creakle and the
boys  i was not mistaken  for the mop came into the schoolroom before
long  and turned out mr  mell and me  who lived where we could  and got
on how we could  for some days  during which we were always in the way
of two or three young women  who had rarely shown themselves before  and
were so continually in the midst of dust that i sneezed almost as much
as if salem house had been a great snuff-box 

one day i was informed by mr  mell that mr  creakle would be home that
evening  in the evening  after tea  i heard that he was come  before
bedtime  i was fetched by the man with the wooden leg to appear before
him 

mr  creakle’s part of the house was a good deal more comfortable than
ours  and he had a snug bit of garden that looked pleasant after the
dusty playground  which was such a desert in miniature  that i thought
no one but a camel  or a dromedary  could have felt at home in it  it
seemed to me a bold thing even to take notice that the passage looked
comfortable  as i went on my way  trembling  to mr  creakle’s presence 
which so abashed me  when i was ushered into it  that i hardly saw
mrs  creakle or miss creakle  who were both there  in the parlour   or
anything but mr  creakle  a stout gentleman with a bunch of watch-chain
and seals  in an arm-chair  with a tumbler and bottle beside him 

 so   said mr  creakle   this is the young gentleman whose teeth are to
be filed  turn him round  

the wooden-legged man turned me about so as to exhibit the placard  and
having afforded time for a full survey of it  turned me about again 
with my face to mr  creakle  and posted himself at mr  creakle’s side 
mr  creakle’s face was fiery  and his eyes were small  and deep in his
head  he had thick veins in his forehead  a little nose  and a large
chin  he was bald on the top of his head  and had some thin wet-looking
hair that was just turning grey  brushed across each temple  so that
the two sides interlaced on his forehead  but the circumstance about
him which impressed me most  was  that he had no voice  but spoke in a
whisper  the exertion this cost him  or the consciousness of talking in
that feeble way  made his angry face so much more angry  and his thick
veins so much thicker  when he spoke  that i am not surprised  on
looking back  at this peculiarity striking me as his chief one   now  
said mr  creakle   what’s the report of this boy  

 there’s nothing against him yet   returned the man with the wooden leg 
 there has been no opportunity  

i thought mr  creakle was disappointed  i thought mrs  and miss creakle
 at whom i now glanced for the first time  and who were  both  thin and
quiet  were not disappointed 

 come here  sir   said mr  creakle  beckoning to me 

 come here   said the man with the wooden leg  repeating the gesture 

 i have the happiness of knowing your father-in-law   whispered mr 
creakle  taking me by the ear   and a worthy man he is  and a man of
a strong character  he knows me  and i know him  do you know me  hey  
said mr  creakle  pinching my ear with ferocious playfulness 

 not yet  sir   i said  flinching with the pain 

 not yet  hey   repeated mr  creakle   but you will soon  hey  

 you will soon  hey   repeated the man with the wooden leg  i afterwards
found that he generally acted  with his strong voice  as mr  creakle’s
interpreter to the boys 

i was very much frightened  and said  i hoped so  if he pleased  i felt 
all this while  as if my ear were blazing  he pinched it so hard 

 i’ll tell you what i am   whispered mr  creakle  letting it go at last 
with a screw at parting that brought the water into my eyes   i’m a
tartar  

 a tartar   said the man with the wooden leg 

 when i say i’ll do a thing  i do it   said mr  creakle   and when i say
i will have a thing done  i will have it done  

   will have a thing done  i will have it done   repeated the man with
the wooden leg 

 i am a determined character   said mr  creakle   that’s what i am  i
do my duty  that’s what i do  my flesh and blood   he looked at mrs 
creakle as he said this   when it rises against me  is not my flesh
and blood  i discard it  has that fellow   to the man with the wooden
leg   been here again  

 no   was the answer 

 no   said mr  creakle   he knows better  he knows me  let him keep
away  i say let him keep away   said mr  creakle  striking his hand upon
the table  and looking at mrs  creakle   for he knows me  now you have
begun to know me too  my young friend  and you may go  take him away  

i was very glad to be ordered away  for mrs  and miss creakle were both
wiping their eyes  and i felt as uncomfortable for them as i did for
myself  but i had a petition on my mind which concerned me so nearly 
that i couldn’t help saying  though i wondered at my own courage 

 if you please  sir   

mr  creakle whispered   hah  what’s this   and bent his eyes upon me  as
if he would have burnt me up with them 

 if you please  sir   i faltered   if i might be allowed  i am very
sorry indeed  sir  for what i did  to take this writing off  before the
boys come back   

whether mr  creakle was in earnest  or whether he only did it to
frighten me  i don’t know  but he made a burst out of his chair  before
which i precipitately retreated  without waiting for the escort of the
man with the wooden leg  and never once stopped until i reached my own
bedroom  where  finding i was not pursued  i went to bed  as it was
time  and lay quaking  for a couple of hours 

next morning mr  sharp came back  mr  sharp was the first master  and
superior to mr  mell  mr  mell took his meals with the boys  but
mr  sharp dined and supped at mr  creakle’s table  he was a limp 
delicate-looking gentleman  i thought  with a good deal of nose  and a
way of carrying his head on one side  as if it were a little too heavy
for him  his hair was very smooth and wavy  but i was informed by the
very first boy who came back that it was a wig  a second-hand one he
said   and that mr  sharp went out every saturday afternoon to get it
curled 

it was no other than tommy traddles who gave me this piece of
intelligence  he was the first boy who returned  he introduced himself
by informing me that i should find his name on the right-hand corner of
the gate  over the top-bolt  upon that i said   traddles   to which he
replied   the same   and then he asked me for a full account of myself
and family 

it was a happy circumstance for me that traddles came back first  he
enjoyed my placard so much  that he saved me from the embarrassment of
either disclosure or concealment  by presenting me to every other boy
who came back  great or small  immediately on his arrival  in this form
of introduction   look here  here’s a game   happily  too  the greater
part of the boys came back low-spirited  and were not so boisterous at
my expense as i had expected  some of them certainly did dance about me
like wild indians  and the greater part could not resist the temptation
of pretending that i was a dog  and patting and soothing me  lest i
should bite  and saying   lie down  sir   and calling me towzer  this
was naturally confusing  among so many strangers  and cost me some
tears  but on the whole it was much better than i had anticipated 

i was not considered as being formally received into the school 
however  until j  steerforth arrived  before this boy  who was
reputed to be a great scholar  and was very good-looking  and at least
half-a-dozen years my senior  i was carried as before a magistrate  he
inquired  under a shed in the playground  into the particulars of my
punishment  and was pleased to express his opinion that it was  a jolly
shame   for which i became bound to him ever afterwards 

 what money have you got  copperfield   he said  walking aside with
me when he had disposed of my affair in these terms  i told him seven
shillings 

 you had better give it to me to take care of   he said   at least  you
can if you like  you needn’t if you don’t like  

i hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion  and opening
peggotty’s purse  turned it upside down into his hand 

 do you want to spend anything now   he asked me 

 no thank you   i replied 

 you can  if you like  you know   said steerforth   say the word  

 no  thank you  sir   i repeated 

 perhaps you’d like to spend a couple of shillings or so  in a bottle of
currant wine by and by  up in the bedroom   said steerforth   you belong
to my bedroom  i find  

it certainly had not occurred to me before  but i said  yes  i should
like that 

 very good   said steerforth   you’ll be glad to spend another shilling
or so  in almond cakes  i dare say  

i said  yes  i should like that  too 

 and another shilling or so in biscuits  and another in fruit  eh   said
steerforth   i say  young copperfield  you’re going it  

i smiled because he smiled  but i was a little troubled in my mind  too 

 well   said steerforth   we must make it stretch as far as we can 
that’s all  i’ll do the best in my power for you  i can go out when i
like  and i’ll smuggle the prog in   with these words he put the money
in his pocket  and kindly told me not to make myself uneasy  he would
take care it should be all right  he was as good as his word  if that
were all right which i had a secret misgiving was nearly all wrong  for
i feared it was a waste of my mother’s two half-crowns  though i had
preserved the piece of paper they were wrapped in  which was a precious
saving  when we went upstairs to bed  he produced the whole seven
shillings  worth  and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight  saying 

 there you are  young copperfield  and a royal spread you’ve got  

i couldn’t think of doing the honours of the feast  at my time of life 
while he was by  my hand shook at the very thought of it  i begged him
to do me the favour of presiding  and my request being seconded by the
other boys who were in that room  he acceded to it  and sat upon my
pillow  handing round the viands  with perfect fairness  i must say  and
dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot  which was
his own property  as to me  i sat on his left hand  and the rest were
grouped about us  on the nearest beds and on the floor 

how well i recollect our sitting there  talking in whispers  or their
talking  and my respectfully listening  i ought rather to say  the
moonlight falling a little way into the room  through the window 
painting a pale window on the floor  and the greater part of us in
shadow  except when steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorus-box 
when he wanted to look for anything on the board  and shed a blue glare
over us that was gone directly  a certain mysterious feeling  consequent
on the darkness  the secrecy of the revel  and the whisper in which
everything was said  steals over me again  and i listen to all they tell
me with a vague feeling of solemnity and awe  which makes me glad that
they are all so near  and frightens me  though i feign to laugh  when
traddles pretends to see a ghost in the corner 

i heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it 
i heard that mr  creakle had not preferred his claim to being a tartar
without reason  that he was the sternest and most severe of masters 
that he laid about him  right and left  every day of his life  charging
in among the boys like a trooper  and slashing away  unmercifully  that
he knew nothing himself  but the art of slashing  being more ignorant
 j  steerforth said  than the lowest boy in the school  that he had
been  a good many years ago  a small hop-dealer in the borough  and had
taken to the schooling business after being bankrupt in hops  and making
away with mrs  creakle’s money  with a good deal more of that sort 
which i wondered how they knew 

i heard that the man with the wooden leg  whose name was tungay  was an
obstinate barbarian who had formerly assisted in the hop business  but
had come into the scholastic line with mr  creakle  in consequence 
as was supposed among the boys  of his having broken his leg in mr 
creakle’s service  and having done a deal of dishonest work for him 
and knowing his secrets  i heard that with the single exception of mr 
creakle  tungay considered the whole establishment  masters and boys 
as his natural enemies  and that the only delight of his life was to be
sour and malicious  i heard that mr  creakle had a son  who had not been
tungay’s friend  and who  assisting in the school  had once held some
remonstrance with his father on an occasion when its discipline was very
cruelly exercised  and was supposed  besides  to have protested against
his father’s usage of his mother  i heard that mr  creakle had turned
him out of doors  in consequence  and that mrs  and miss creakle had
been in a sad way  ever since 

but the greatest wonder that i heard of mr  creakle was  there being one
boy in the school on whom he never ventured to lay a hand  and that
boy being j  steerforth  steerforth himself confirmed this when it was
stated  and said that he should like to begin to see him do it  on being
asked by a mild boy  not me  how he would proceed if he did begin to see
him do it  he dipped a match into his phosphorus-box on purpose to shed
a glare over his reply  and said he would commence by knocking him down
with a blow on the forehead from the seven-and-sixpenny ink-bottle
that was always on the mantelpiece  we sat in the dark for some time 
breathless 

i heard that mr  sharp and mr  mell were both supposed to be wretchedly
paid  and that when there was hot and cold meat for dinner at mr 
creakle’s table  mr  sharp was always expected to say he preferred cold 
which was again corroborated by j  steerforth  the only parlour-boarder 
i heard that mr  sharp’s wig didn’t fit him  and that he needn’t be so
 bounceable   somebody else said  bumptious   about it  because his own
red hair was very plainly to be seen behind 

i heard that one boy  who was a coal-merchant’s son  came as a set-off
against the coal-bill  and was called  on that account   exchange or
barter   a name selected from the arithmetic book as expressing this
arrangement  i heard that the table beer was a robbery of parents  and
the pudding an imposition  i heard that miss creakle was regarded by the
school in general as being in love with steerforth  and i am sure  as i
sat in the dark  thinking of his nice voice  and his fine face  and his
easy manner  and his curling hair  i thought it very likely  i heard
that mr  mell was not a bad sort of fellow  but hadn’t a sixpence to
bless himself with  and that there was no doubt that old mrs  mell  his
mother  was as poor as job  i thought of my breakfast then  and what had
sounded like  my charley   but i was  i am glad to remember  as mute as
a mouse about it 

the hearing of all this  and a good deal more  outlasted the banquet
some time  the greater part of the guests had gone to bed as soon as the
eating and drinking were over  and we  who had remained whispering and
listening half-undressed  at last betook ourselves to bed  too 

 good night  young copperfield   said steerforth   i’ll take care of
you    you’re very kind   i gratefully returned   i am very much obliged
to you  

 you haven’t got a sister  have you   said steerforth  yawning 

 no   i answered 

 that’s a pity   said steerforth   if you had had one  i should think
she would have been a pretty  timid  little  bright-eyed sort of girl  i
should have liked to know her  good night  young copperfield  

 good night  sir   i replied 

i thought of him very much after i went to bed  and raised myself 
i recollect  to look at him where he lay in the moonlight  with his
handsome face turned up  and his head reclining easily on his arm  he
was a person of great power in my eyes  that was  of course  the reason
of my mind running on him  no veiled future dimly glanced upon him in
the moonbeams  there was no shadowy picture of his footsteps  in the
garden that i dreamed of walking in all night 



chapter 7  my  first half  at salem house


school began in earnest next day  a profound impression was made
upon me  i remember  by the roar of voices in the schoolroom suddenly
becoming hushed as death when mr  creakle entered after breakfast  and
stood in the doorway looking round upon us like a giant in a story-book
surveying his captives 

tungay stood at mr  creakle’s elbow  he had no occasion  i thought 
to cry out  silence   so ferociously  for the boys were all struck
speechless and motionless 

mr  creakle was seen to speak  and tungay was heard  to this effect 

 now  boys  this is a new half  take care what you’re about  in this new
half  come fresh up to the lessons  i advise you  for i come fresh up
to the punishment  i won’t flinch  it will be of no use your rubbing
yourselves  you won’t rub the marks out that i shall give you  now get
to work  every boy  

when this dreadful exordium was over  and tungay had stumped out again 
mr  creakle came to where i sat  and told me that if i were famous for
biting  he was famous for biting  too  he then showed me the cane  and
asked me what i thought of that  for a tooth  was it a sharp tooth  hey 
was it a double tooth  hey  had it a deep prong  hey  did it bite  hey 
did it bite  at every question he gave me a fleshy cut with it that made
me writhe  so i was very soon made free of salem house  as steerforth
said   and was very soon in tears also 

not that i mean to say these were special marks of distinction 
which only i received  on the contrary  a large majority of the boys
 especially the smaller ones  were visited with similar instances
of notice  as mr  creakle made the round of the schoolroom  half the
establishment was writhing and crying  before the day’s work began  and
how much of it had writhed and cried before the day’s work was over  i
am really afraid to recollect  lest i should seem to exaggerate 

i should think there never can have been a man who enjoyed his
profession more than mr  creakle did  he had a delight in cutting at
the boys  which was like the satisfaction of a craving appetite  i am
confident that he couldn’t resist a chubby boy  especially  that there
was a fascination in such a subject  which made him restless in his
mind  until he had scored and marked him for the day  i was chubby
myself  and ought to know  i am sure when i think of the fellow now  my
blood rises against him with the disinterested indignation i should
feel if i could have known all about him without having ever been in his
power  but it rises hotly  because i know him to have been an incapable
brute  who had no more right to be possessed of the great trust he held 
than to be lord high admiral  or commander-in-chief  in either of
which capacities it is probable that he would have done infinitely less
mischief 

miserable little propitiators of a remorseless idol  how abject we were
to him  what a launch in life i think it now  on looking back  to be so
mean and servile to a man of such parts and pretensions 

here i sit at the desk again  watching his eye  humbly watching his eye 
as he rules a ciphering-book for another victim whose hands have just
been flattened by that identical ruler  and who is trying to wipe the
sting out with a pocket-handkerchief  i have plenty to do  i don’t watch
his eye in idleness  but because i am morbidly attracted to it  in a
dread desire to know what he will do next  and whether it will be my
turn to suffer  or somebody else’s  a lane of small boys beyond me  with
the same interest in his eye  watch it too  i think he knows it 
though he pretends he don’t  he makes dreadful mouths as he rules the
ciphering-book  and now he throws his eye sideways down our lane  and we
all droop over our books and tremble  a moment afterwards we are again
eyeing him  an unhappy culprit  found guilty of imperfect exercise 
approaches at his command  the culprit falters excuses  and professes a
determination to do better tomorrow  mr  creakle cuts a joke before he
beats him  and we laugh at it   miserable little dogs  we laugh  with
our visages as white as ashes  and our hearts sinking into our boots 

here i sit at the desk again  on a drowsy summer afternoon  a buzz and
hum go up around me  as if the boys were so many bluebottles  a cloggy
sensation of the lukewarm fat of meat is upon me  we dined an hour or
two ago   and my head is as heavy as so much lead  i would give the
world to go to sleep  i sit with my eye on mr  creakle  blinking at him
like a young owl  when sleep overpowers me for a minute  he still looms
through my slumber  ruling those ciphering-books  until he softly comes
behind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him  with a red ridge
across my back 

here i am in the playground  with my eye still fascinated by him  though
i can’t see him  the window at a little distance from which i know he is
having his dinner  stands for him  and i eye that instead  if he shows
his face near it  mine assumes an imploring and submissive expression 
if he looks out through the glass  the boldest boy  steerforth excepted 
stops in the middle of a shout or yell  and becomes contemplative  one
day  traddles  the most unfortunate boy in the world  breaks that window
accidentally  with a ball  i shudder at this moment with the tremendous
sensation of seeing it done  and feeling that the ball has bounded on to
mr  creakle’s sacred head 

poor traddles  in a tight sky-blue suit that made his arms and legs like
german sausages  or roly-poly puddings  he was the merriest and most
miserable of all the boys  he was always being caned  i think he was
caned every day that half-year  except one holiday monday when he was
only ruler’d on both hands  and was always going to write to his uncle
about it  and never did  after laying his head on the desk for a little
while  he would cheer up  somehow  begin to laugh again  and draw
skeletons all over his slate  before his eyes were dry  i used at first
to wonder what comfort traddles found in drawing skeletons  and for some
time looked upon him as a sort of hermit  who reminded himself by those
symbols of mortality that caning couldn’t last for ever  but i believe
he only did it because they were easy  and didn’t want any features 

he was very honourable  traddles was  and held it as a solemn duty
in the boys to stand by one another  he suffered for this on several
occasions  and particularly once  when steerforth laughed in church 
and the beadle thought it was traddles  and took him out  i see him now 
going away in custody  despised by the congregation  he never said
who was the real offender  though he smarted for it next day  and was
imprisoned so many hours that he came forth with a whole churchyard-full
of skeletons swarming all over his latin dictionary  but he had his
reward  steerforth said there was nothing of the sneak in traddles  and
we all felt that to be the highest praise  for my part  i could have
gone through a good deal  though i was much less brave than traddles 
and nothing like so old  to have won such a recompense 

to see steerforth walk to church before us  arm-in-arm with miss
creakle  was one of the great sights of my life  i didn’t think miss
creakle equal to little em’ly in point of beauty  and i didn’t love
her  i didn’t dare   but i thought her a young lady of extraordinary
attractions  and in point of gentility not to be surpassed  when
steerforth  in white trousers  carried her parasol for her  i felt proud
to know him  and believed that she could not choose but adore him with
all her heart  mr  sharp and mr  mell were both notable personages in my
eyes  but steerforth was to them what the sun was to two stars 

steerforth continued his protection of me  and proved a very useful
friend  since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his
countenance  he couldn’t  or at all events he didn’t  defend me from mr 
creakle  who was very severe with me  but whenever i had been treated
worse than usual  he always told me that i wanted a little of his pluck 
and that he wouldn’t have stood it himself  which i felt he intended
for encouragement  and considered to be very kind of him  there was one
advantage  and only one that i know of  in mr  creakle’s severity  he
found my placard in his way when he came up or down behind the form on
which i sat  and wanted to make a cut at me in passing  for this reason
it was soon taken off  and i saw it no more 

an accidental circumstance cemented the intimacy between steerforth
and me  in a manner that inspired me with great pride and satisfaction 
though it sometimes led to inconvenience  it happened on one occasion 
when he was doing me the honour of talking to me in the playground  that
i hazarded the observation that something or somebody  i forget what
now  was like something or somebody in peregrine pickle  he said nothing
at the time  but when i was going to bed at night  asked me if i had got
that book 

i told him no  and explained how it was that i had read it  and all
those other books of which i have made mention 

 and do you recollect them   steerforth said 

 oh yes   i replied  i had a good memory  and i believed i recollected
them very well 

 then i tell you what  young copperfield   said steerforth   you
shall tell  em to me  i can’t get to sleep very early at night  and i
generally wake rather early in the morning  we’ll go over  em one after
another  we’ll make some regular arabian nights of it  

i felt extremely flattered by this arrangement  and we commenced
carrying it into execution that very evening  what ravages i committed
on my favourite authors in the course of my interpretation of them  i am
not in a condition to say  and should be very unwilling to know  but
i had a profound faith in them  and i had  to the best of my belief 
a simple  earnest manner of narrating what i did narrate  and these
qualities went a long way 

the drawback was  that i was often sleepy at night  or out of spirits
and indisposed to resume the story  and then it was rather hard work 
and it must be done  for to disappoint or to displease steerforth was of
course out of the question  in the morning  too  when i felt weary  and
should have enjoyed another hour’s repose very much  it was a tiresome
thing to be roused  like the sultana scheherazade  and forced into a
long story before the getting-up bell rang  but steerforth was resolute 
and as he explained to me  in return  my sums and exercises  and
anything in my tasks that was too hard for me  i was no loser by the
transaction  let me do myself justice  however  i was moved by no
interested or selfish motive  nor was i moved by fear of him  i admired
and loved him  and his approval was return enough  it was so precious to
me that i look back on these trifles  now  with an aching heart 

steerforth was considerate  too  and showed his consideration  in
one particular instance  in an unflinching manner that was a little
tantalizing  i suspect  to poor traddles and the rest  peggotty’s
promised letter  what a comfortable letter it was   arrived before
 the half  was many weeks old  and with it a cake in a perfect nest
of oranges  and two bottles of cowslip wine  this treasure  as in duty
bound  i laid at the feet of steerforth  and begged him to dispense 

 now  i’ll tell you what  young copperfield   said he   the wine shall
be kept to wet your whistle when you are story-telling  

i blushed at the idea  and begged him  in my modesty  not to think of
it  but he said he had observed i was sometimes hoarse  a little roopy
was his exact expression  and it should be  every drop  devoted to the
purpose he had mentioned  accordingly  it was locked up in his box  and
drawn off by himself in a phial  and administered to me through a
piece of quill in the cork  when i was supposed to be in want of a
restorative  sometimes  to make it a more sovereign specific  he was so
kind as to squeeze orange juice into it  or to stir it up with ginger 
or dissolve a peppermint drop in it  and although i cannot assert that
the flavour was improved by these experiments  or that it was exactly
the compound one would have chosen for a stomachic  the last thing at
night and the first thing in the morning  i drank it gratefully and was
very sensible of his attention 

we seem  to me  to have been months over peregrine  and months more over
the other stories  the institution never flagged for want of a story  i
am certain  and the wine lasted out almost as well as the matter  poor
traddles  i never think of that boy but with a strange disposition to
laugh  and with tears in my eyes  was a sort of chorus  in general 
and affected to be convulsed with mirth at the comic parts  and to be
overcome with fear when there was any passage of an alarming character
in the narrative  this rather put me out  very often  it was a great
jest of his  i recollect  to pretend that he couldn’t keep his teeth
from chattering  whenever mention was made of an alguazill in connexion
with the adventures of gil blas  and i remember that when gil blas met
the captain of the robbers in madrid  this unlucky joker counterfeited
such an ague of terror  that he was overheard by mr  creakle  who
was prowling about the passage  and handsomely flogged for disorderly
conduct in the bedroom  whatever i had within me that was romantic and
dreamy  was encouraged by so much story-telling in the dark  and in that
respect the pursuit may not have been very profitable to me  but the
being cherished as a kind of plaything in my room  and the consciousness
that this accomplishment of mine was bruited about among the boys  and
attracted a good deal of notice to me though i was the youngest there 
stimulated me to exertion  in a school carried on by sheer cruelty 
whether it is presided over by a dunce or not  there is not likely to
be much learnt  i believe our boys were  generally  as ignorant a set
as any schoolboys in existence  they were too much troubled and knocked
about to learn  they could no more do that to advantage  than any one
can do anything to advantage in a life of constant misfortune  torment 
and worry  but my little vanity  and steerforth’s help  urged me on
somehow  and without saving me from much  if anything  in the way of
punishment  made me  for the time i was there  an exception to the
general body  insomuch that i did steadily pick up some crumbs of
knowledge 

in this i was much assisted by mr  mell  who had a liking for me that
i am grateful to remember  it always gave me pain to observe that
steerforth treated him with systematic disparagement  and seldom lost
an occasion of wounding his feelings  or inducing others to do so 
this troubled me the more for a long time  because i had soon told
steerforth  from whom i could no more keep such a secret  than i could
keep a cake or any other tangible possession  about the two old women
mr  mell had taken me to see  and i was always afraid that steerforth
would let it out  and twit him with it 

we little thought  any one of us  i dare say  when i ate my breakfast
that first morning  and went to sleep under the shadow of the peacock’s
feathers to the sound of the flute  what consequences would come of the
introduction into those alms-houses of my insignificant person  but the
visit had its unforeseen consequences  and of a serious sort  too  in
their way 

one day when mr  creakle kept the house from indisposition  which
naturally diffused a lively joy through the school  there was a good
deal of noise in the course of the morning’s work  the great relief and
satisfaction experienced by the boys made them difficult to manage  and
though the dreaded tungay brought his wooden leg in twice or thrice  and
took notes of the principal offenders  names  no great impression was
made by it  as they were pretty sure of getting into trouble tomorrow 
do what they would  and thought it wise  no doubt  to enjoy themselves
today 

it was  properly  a half-holiday  being saturday  but as the noise in
the playground would have disturbed mr  creakle  and the weather was
not favourable for going out walking  we were ordered into school in the
afternoon  and set some lighter tasks than usual  which were made for
the occasion  it was the day of the week on which mr  sharp went out to
get his wig curled  so mr  mell  who always did the drudgery  whatever
it was  kept school by himself  if i could associate the idea of a bull
or a bear with anyone so mild as mr  mell  i should think of him  in
connexion with that afternoon when the uproar was at its height  as of
one of those animals  baited by a thousand dogs  i recall him bending
his aching head  supported on his bony hand  over the book on his desk 
and wretchedly endeavouring to get on with his tiresome work  amidst an
uproar that might have made the speaker of the house of commons giddy 
boys started in and out of their places  playing at puss in the corner
with other boys  there were laughing boys  singing boys  talking boys 
dancing boys  howling boys  boys shuffled with their feet  boys whirled
about him  grinning  making faces  mimicking him behind his back and
before his eyes  mimicking his poverty  his boots  his coat  his mother 
everything belonging to him that they should have had consideration for 

 silence   cried mr  mell  suddenly rising up  and striking his desk
with the book   what does this mean  it’s impossible to bear it  it’s
maddening  how can you do it to me  boys  

it was my book that he struck his desk with  and as i stood beside him 
following his eye as it glanced round the room  i saw the boys all stop 
some suddenly surprised  some half afraid  and some sorry perhaps 

steerforth’s place was at the bottom of the school  at the opposite end
of the long room  he was lounging with his back against the wall  and
his hands in his pockets  and looked at mr  mell with his mouth shut up
as if he were whistling  when mr  mell looked at him 

 silence  mr  steerforth   said mr  mell 

 silence yourself   said steerforth  turning red   whom are you talking
to  

 sit down   said mr  mell 

 sit down yourself   said steerforth   and mind your business  

there was a titter  and some applause  but mr  mell was so white  that
silence immediately succeeded  and one boy  who had darted out behind
him to imitate his mother again  changed his mind  and pretended to want
a pen mended 

 if you think  steerforth   said mr  mell   that i am not acquainted
with the power you can establish over any mind here   he laid his hand 
without considering what he did  as i supposed   upon my head   or that
i have not observed you  within a few minutes  urging your juniors on to
every sort of outrage against me  you are mistaken  

 i don’t give myself the trouble of thinking at all about you   said
steerforth  coolly   so i’m not mistaken  as it happens  

 and when you make use of your position of favouritism here  sir  
pursued mr  mell  with his lip trembling very much   to insult a
gentleman   

 a what   where is he   said steerforth 

here somebody cried out   shame  j  steerforth  too bad   it was
traddles  whom mr  mell instantly discomfited by bidding him hold his
tongue     to insult one who is not fortunate in life  sir  and who
never gave you the least offence  and the many reasons for not insulting
whom you are old enough and wise enough to understand   said mr  mell 
with his lips trembling more and more   you commit a mean and base
action  you can sit down or stand up as you please  sir  copperfield  go
on  

 young copperfield   said steerforth  coming forward up the room 
 stop a bit  i tell you what  mr  mell  once for all  when you take the
liberty of calling me mean or base  or anything of that sort  you are
an impudent beggar  you are always a beggar  you know  but when you do
that  you are an impudent beggar  

i am not clear whether he was going to strike mr  mell  or mr  mell was
going to strike him  or there was any such intention on either side 
i saw a rigidity come upon the whole school as if they had been turned
into stone  and found mr  creakle in the midst of us  with tungay at his
side  and mrs  and miss creakle looking in at the door as if they were
frightened  mr  mell  with his elbows on his desk and his face in his
hands  sat  for some moments  quite still 

 mr  mell   said mr  creakle  shaking him by the arm  and his whisper
was so audible now  that tungay felt it unnecessary to repeat his words 
 you have not forgotten yourself  i hope  

 no  sir  no   returned the master  showing his face  and shaking his
head  and rubbing his hands in great agitation   no  sir  no  i have
remembered myself  i  no  mr  creakle  i have not forgotten myself  i  i
have remembered myself  sir  i  i  could wish you had remembered me a
little sooner  mr  creakle  it  it  would have been more kind  sir  more
just  sir  it would have saved me something  sir  

mr  creakle  looking hard at mr  mell  put his hand on tungay’s
shoulder  and got his feet upon the form close by  and sat upon the
desk  after still looking hard at mr  mell from his throne  as he
shook his head  and rubbed his hands  and remained in the same state of
agitation  mr  creakle turned to steerforth  and said 

 now  sir  as he don’t condescend to tell me  what is this  

steerforth evaded the question for a little while  looking in scorn and
anger on his opponent  and remaining silent  i could not help thinking
even in that interval  i remember  what a noble fellow he was in
appearance  and how homely and plain mr  mell looked opposed to him 

 what did he mean by talking about favourites  then   said steerforth at
length 

 favourites   repeated mr  creakle  with the veins in his forehead
swelling quickly   who talked about favourites  

 he did   said steerforth 

 and pray  what did you mean by that  sir   demanded mr  creakle 
turning angrily on his assistant 

 i meant  mr  creakle   he returned in a low voice   as i said  that
no pupil had a right to avail himself of his position of favouritism to
degrade me  

 to degrade you   said mr  creakle   my stars  but give me leave to ask
you  mr  what’s-your-name   and here mr  creakle folded his arms  cane
and all  upon his chest  and made such a knot of his brows that his
little eyes were hardly visible below them   whether  when you talk
about favourites  you showed proper respect to me  to me  sir   said mr 
creakle  darting his head at him suddenly  and drawing it back again 
 the principal of this establishment  and your employer  

 it was not judicious  sir  i am willing to admit   said mr  mell   i
should not have done so  if i had been cool  

here steerforth struck in 

 then he said i was mean  and then he said i was base  and then i called
him a beggar  if i had been cool  perhaps i shouldn’t have called him a
beggar  but i did  and i am ready to take the consequences of it  

without considering  perhaps  whether there were any consequences to
be taken  i felt quite in a glow at this gallant speech  it made an
impression on the boys too  for there was a low stir among them  though
no one spoke a word 

 i am surprised  steerforth  although your candour does you honour  
said mr  creakle   does you honour  certainly  i am surprised 
steerforth  i must say  that you should attach such an epithet to any
person employed and paid in salem house  sir  

steerforth gave a short laugh 

 that’s not an answer  sir   said mr  creakle   to my remark  i expect
more than that from you  steerforth  

if mr  mell looked homely  in my eyes  before the handsome boy  it would
be quite impossible to say how homely mr  creakle looked   let him deny
it   said steerforth 

 deny that he is a beggar  steerforth   cried mr  creakle   why  where
does he go a-begging  

 if he is not a beggar himself  his near relation’s one   said
steerforth   it’s all the same  

he glanced at me  and mr  mell’s hand gently patted me upon the
shoulder  i looked up with a flush upon my face and remorse in my heart 
but mr  mell’s eyes were fixed on steerforth  he continued to pat me
kindly on the shoulder  but he looked at him 

 since you expect me  mr  creakle  to justify myself   said steerforth 
 and to say what i mean   what i have to say is  that his mother lives
on charity in an alms-house  

mr  mell still looked at him  and still patted me kindly on the
shoulder  and said to himself  in a whisper  if i heard right   yes  i
thought so  

mr  creakle turned to his assistant  with a severe frown and laboured
politeness 

 now  you hear what this gentleman says  mr  mell  have the goodness  if
you please  to set him right before the assembled school  

 he is right  sir  without correction   returned mr  mell  in the midst
of a dead silence   what he has said is true  

 be so good then as declare publicly  will you   said mr  creakle 
putting his head on one side  and rolling his eyes round the school 
 whether it ever came to my knowledge until this moment  

 i believe not directly   he returned 

 why  you know not   said mr  creakle   don’t you  man  

 i apprehend you never supposed my worldly circumstances to be very
good   replied the assistant   you know what my position is  and always
has been  here  

 i apprehend  if you come to that   said mr  creakle  with his veins
swelling again bigger than ever   that you’ve been in a wrong position
altogether  and mistook this for a charity school  mr  mell  we’ll part 
if you please  the sooner the better  

 there is no time   answered mr  mell  rising   like the present  

 sir  to you   said mr  creakle 

 i take my leave of you  mr  creakle  and all of you   said mr  mell 
glancing round the room  and again patting me gently on the shoulders 
 james steerforth  the best wish i can leave you is that you may come to
be ashamed of what you have done today  at present i would prefer to see
you anything rather than a friend  to me  or to anyone in whom i feel an
interest  

once more he laid his hand upon my shoulder  and then taking his
flute and a few books from his desk  and leaving the key in it for his
successor  he went out of the school  with his property under his arm 
mr  creakle then made a speech  through tungay  in which he thanked
steerforth for asserting  though perhaps too warmly  the independence
and respectability of salem house  and which he wound up by shaking
hands with steerforth  while we gave three cheers  i did not quite know
what for  but i supposed for steerforth  and so joined in them ardently 
though i felt miserable  mr  creakle then caned tommy traddles for
being discovered in tears  instead of cheers  on account of mr  mell’s
departure  and went back to his sofa  or his bed  or wherever he had
come from 

we were left to ourselves now  and looked very blank  i recollect  on
one another  for myself  i felt so much self-reproach and contrition for
my part in what had happened  that nothing would have enabled me to keep
back my tears but the fear that steerforth  who often looked at me  i
saw  might think it unfriendly  or  i should rather say  considering our
relative ages  and the feeling with which i regarded him  undutiful  if
i showed the emotion which distressed me  he was very angry with
traddles  and said he was glad he had caught it 

poor traddles  who had passed the stage of lying with his head upon the
desk  and was relieving himself as usual with a burst of skeletons  said
he didn’t care  mr  mell was ill-used 

 who has ill-used him  you girl   said steerforth 

 why  you have   returned traddles 

 what have i done   said steerforth 

 what have you done   retorted traddles   hurt his feelings  and lost
him his situation  

 his feelings   repeated steerforth disdainfully   his feelings will
soon get the better of it  i’ll be bound  his feelings are not like
yours  miss traddles  as to his situation  which was a precious one 
wasn’t it   do you suppose i am not going to write home  and take care
that he gets some money  polly  

we thought this intention very noble in steerforth  whose mother was
a widow  and rich  and would do almost anything  it was said  that he
asked her  we were all extremely glad to see traddles so put down 
and exalted steerforth to the skies  especially when he told us  as he
condescended to do  that what he had done had been done expressly for
us  and for our cause  and that he had conferred a great boon upon us
by unselfishly doing it  but i must say that when i was going on with a
story in the dark that night  mr  mell’s old flute seemed more than once
to sound mournfully in my ears  and that when at last steerforth was
tired  and i lay down in my bed  i fancied it playing so sorrowfully
somewhere  that i was quite wretched 

i soon forgot him in the contemplation of steerforth  who  in an easy
amateur way  and without any book  he seemed to me to know everything by
heart   took some of his classes until a new master was found  the new
master came from a grammar school  and before he entered on his duties 
dined in the parlour one day  to be introduced to steerforth  steerforth
approved of him highly  and told us he was a brick  without exactly
understanding what learned distinction was meant by this  i respected
him greatly for it  and had no doubt whatever of his superior knowledge 
though he never took the pains with me  not that i was anybody  that mr 
mell had taken 

there was only one other event in this half-year  out of the daily
school-life  that made an impression upon me which still survives  it
survives for many reasons 

one afternoon  when we were all harassed into a state of dire confusion 
and mr  creakle was laying about him dreadfully  tungay came in  and
called out in his usual strong way   visitors for copperfield  

a few words were interchanged between him and mr  creakle  as  who the
visitors were  and what room they were to be shown into  and then i  who
had  according to custom  stood up on the announcement being made  and
felt quite faint with astonishment  was told to go by the back stairs
and get a clean frill on  before i repaired to the dining-room  these
orders i obeyed  in such a flutter and hurry of my young spirits as
i had never known before  and when i got to the parlour door  and the
thought came into my head that it might be my mother  i had only thought
of mr  or miss murdstone until then  i drew back my hand from the lock 
and stopped to have a sob before i went in 

at first i saw nobody  but feeling a pressure against the door  i looked
round it  and there  to my amazement  were mr  peggotty and ham  ducking
at me with their hats  and squeezing one another against the wall  i
could not help laughing  but it was much more in the pleasure of seeing
them  than at the appearance they made  we shook hands in a very
cordial way  and i laughed and laughed  until i pulled out my
pocket-handkerchief and wiped my eyes 

mr  peggotty  who never shut his mouth once  i remember  during the
visit  showed great concern when he saw me do this  and nudged ham to
say something 

 cheer up  mas’r davy bor    said ham  in his simpering way   why  how
you have growed  

 am i grown   i said  drying my eyes  i was not crying at anything
in particular that i know of  but somehow it made me cry  to see old
friends 

 growed  mas’r davy bor   ain’t he growed   said ham 

 ain’t he growed   said mr  peggotty 

they made me laugh again by laughing at each other  and then we all
three laughed until i was in danger of crying again 

 do you know how mama is  mr  peggotty   i said   and how my dear  dear 
old peggotty is  

 oncommon   said mr  peggotty 

 and little em’ly  and mrs  gummidge  

 on  common   said mr  peggotty 

there was a silence  mr  peggotty  to relieve it  took two prodigious
lobsters  and an enormous crab  and a large canvas bag of shrimps  out
of his pockets  and piled them up in ham’s arms 

 you see   said mr  peggotty   knowing as you was partial to a little
relish with your wittles when you was along with us  we took the
liberty  the old mawther biled  em  she did  mrs  gummidge biled  em 
yes   said mr  peggotty  slowly  who i thought appeared to stick to the
subject on account of having no other subject ready   mrs  gummidge  i
do assure you  she biled  em  

i expressed my thanks  and mr  peggotty  after looking at ham  who stood
smiling sheepishly over the shellfish  without making any attempt to
help him  said 

 we come  you see  the wind and tide making in our favour  in one of our
yarmouth lugs to gravesen   my sister she wrote to me the name of this
here place  and wrote to me as if ever i chanced to come to gravesen  
i was to come over and inquire for mas’r davy and give her dooty 
humbly wishing him well and reporting of the fam’ly as they was oncommon
toe-be-sure  little em’ly  you see  she’ll write to my sister when i go
back  as i see you and as you was similarly oncommon  and so we make it
quite a merry-go-rounder  

i was obliged to consider a little before i understood what mr  peggotty
meant by this figure  expressive of a complete circle of intelligence  i
then thanked him heartily  and said  with a consciousness of reddening 
that i supposed little em’ly was altered too  since we used to pick up
shells and pebbles on the beach 

 she’s getting to be a woman  that’s wot she’s getting to be   said mr 
peggotty   ask him   he meant ham  who beamed with delight and assent
over the bag of shrimps 

 her pretty face   said mr  peggotty  with his own shining like a light 

 her learning   said ham 

 her writing   said mr  peggotty   why it’s as black as jet  and so
large it is  you might see it anywheres  

it was perfectly delightful to behold with what enthusiasm mr  peggotty
became inspired when he thought of his little favourite  he stands
before me again  his bluff hairy face irradiating with a joyful love and
pride  for which i can find no description  his honest eyes fire up  and
sparkle  as if their depths were stirred by something bright  his broad
chest heaves with pleasure  his strong loose hands clench themselves 
in his earnestness  and he emphasizes what he says with a right arm that
shows  in my pigmy view  like a sledge-hammer 

ham was quite as earnest as he  i dare say they would have said much
more about her  if they had not been abashed by the unexpected coming in
of steerforth  who  seeing me in a corner speaking with two strangers 
stopped in a song he was singing  and said   i didn’t know you were
here  young copperfield    for it was not the usual visiting room  and
crossed by us on his way out 

i am not sure whether it was in the pride of having such a friend as
steerforth  or in the desire to explain to him how i came to have such a
friend as mr  peggotty  that i called to him as he was going away  but i
said  modestly  good heaven  how it all comes back to me this long time
afterwards   

 don’t go  steerforth  if you please  these are two yarmouth
boatmen  very kind  good people  who are relations of my nurse  and have
come from gravesend to see me  

 aye  aye   said steerforth  returning   i am glad to see them  how are
you both  

there was an ease in his manner  a gay and light manner it was  but not
swaggering  which i still believe to have borne a kind of enchantment
with it  i still believe him  in virtue of this carriage  his animal
spirits  his delightful voice  his handsome face and figure  and  for
aught i know  of some inborn power of attraction besides  which i think
a few people possess   to have carried a spell with him to which it was
a natural weakness to yield  and which not many persons could withstand 
i could not but see how pleased they were with him  and how they seemed
to open their hearts to him in a moment 

 you must let them know at home  if you please  mr  peggotty   i said 
 when that letter is sent  that mr  steerforth is very kind to me  and
that i don’t know what i should ever do here without him  

 nonsense   said steerforth  laughing   you mustn’t tell them anything
of the sort  

 and if mr  steerforth ever comes into norfolk or suffolk  mr 
peggotty   i said   while i am there  you may depend upon it i shall
bring him to yarmouth  if he will let me  to see your house  you never
saw such a good house  steerforth  it’s made out of a boat  

 made out of a boat  is it   said steerforth   it’s the right sort of a
house for such a thorough-built boatman  

 so  tis  sir  so  tis  sir   said ham  grinning   you’re right  young
gen’l’m’n  mas’r davy bor   gen’l’m’n’s right  a thorough-built boatman 
hor  hor  that’s what he is  too  

mr  peggotty was no less pleased than his nephew  though his modesty
forbade him to claim a personal compliment so vociferously 

 well  sir   he said  bowing and chuckling  and tucking in the ends
of his neckerchief at his breast   i thankee  sir  i thankee  i do my
endeavours in my line of life  sir  

 the best of men can do no more  mr  peggotty   said steerforth  he had
got his name already 

 i’ll pound it  it’s wot you do yourself  sir   said mr  peggotty 
shaking his head   and wot you do well  right well  i thankee  sir  i’m
obleeged to you  sir  for your welcoming manner of me  i’m rough  sir 
but i’m ready  least ways  i hope i’m ready  you unnerstand  my house
ain’t much for to see  sir  but it’s hearty at your service if ever you
should come along with mas’r davy to see it  i’m a reg’lar dodman 
i am   said mr  peggotty  by which he meant snail  and this was in
allusion to his being slow to go  for he had attempted to go after every
sentence  and had somehow or other come back again   but i wish you both
well  and i wish you happy  

ham echoed this sentiment  and we parted with them in the heartiest
manner  i was almost tempted that evening to tell steerforth about
pretty little em’ly  but i was too timid of mentioning her name  and
too much afraid of his laughing at me  i remember that i thought a good
deal  and in an uneasy sort of way  about mr  peggotty having said that
she was getting on to be a woman  but i decided that was nonsense 

we transported the shellfish  or the  relish  as mr  peggotty had
modestly called it  up into our room unobserved  and made a great supper
that evening  but traddles couldn’t get happily out of it  he was too
unfortunate even to come through a supper like anybody else  he was
taken ill in the night  quite prostrate he was  in consequence of crab 
and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills  to an extent
which demple  whose father was a doctor  said was enough to undermine
a horse’s constitution  received a caning and six chapters of greek
testament for refusing to confess 

the rest of the half-year is a jumble in my recollection of the daily
strife and struggle of our lives  of the waning summer and the changing
season  of the frosty mornings when we were rung out of bed  and the
cold  cold smell of the dark nights when we were rung into bed again  of
the evening schoolroom dimly lighted and indifferently warmed  and the
morning schoolroom which was nothing but a great shivering-machine  of
the alternation of boiled beef with roast beef  and boiled mutton with
roast mutton  of clods of bread-and-butter  dog’s-eared lesson-books 
cracked slates  tear-blotted copy-books  canings  rulerings 
hair-cuttings  rainy sundays  suet-puddings  and a dirty atmosphere of
ink  surrounding all 

i well remember though  how the distant idea of the holidays  after
seeming for an immense time to be a stationary speck  began to come
towards us  and to grow and grow  how from counting months  we came to
weeks  and then to days  and how i then began to be afraid that i should
not be sent for and when i learnt from steerforth that i had been sent
for  and was certainly to go home  had dim forebodings that i might
break my leg first  how the breaking-up day changed its place fast  at
last  from the week after next to next week  this week  the day after
tomorrow  tomorrow  today  tonight  when i was inside the yarmouth mail 
and going home 

i had many a broken sleep inside the yarmouth mail  and many an
incoherent dream of all these things  but when i awoke at intervals  the
ground outside the window was not the playground of salem house  and the
sound in my ears was not the sound of mr  creakle giving it to traddles 
but the sound of the coachman touching up the horses 



chapter 8  my holidays  especially one happy afternoon


when we arrived before day at the inn where the mail stopped  which was
not the inn where my friend the waiter lived  i was shown up to a nice
little bedroom  with dolphin painted on the door  very cold i was  i
know  notwithstanding the hot tea they had given me before a large fire
downstairs  and very glad i was to turn into the dolphin’s bed  pull the
dolphin’s blankets round my head  and go to sleep 

mr  barkis the carrier was to call for me in the morning at nine
o’clock  i got up at eight  a little giddy from the shortness of my
night’s rest  and was ready for him before the appointed time  he
received me exactly as if not five minutes had elapsed since we were
last together  and i had only been into the hotel to get change for
sixpence  or something of that sort 

as soon as i and my box were in the cart  and the carrier seated  the
lazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace 

 you look very well  mr  barkis   i said  thinking he would like to know
it 

mr  barkis rubbed his cheek with his cuff  and then looked at his cuff
as if he expected to find some of the bloom upon it  but made no other
acknowledgement of the compliment 

 i gave your message  mr  barkis   i said   i wrote to peggotty  

 ah   said mr  barkis 

mr  barkis seemed gruff  and answered drily 

 wasn’t it right  mr  barkis   i asked  after a little hesitation 

 why  no   said mr  barkis 

 not the message  

 the message was right enough  perhaps   said mr  barkis   but it come
to an end there  

not understanding what he meant  i repeated inquisitively   came to an
end  mr  barkis  

 nothing come of it   he explained  looking at me sideways   no answer  

 there was an answer expected  was there  mr  barkis   said i  opening
my eyes  for this was a new light to me 

 when a man says he’s willin    said mr  barkis  turning his glance
slowly on me again   it’s as much as to say  that man’s a-waitin  for a
answer  

 well  mr  barkis  

 well   said mr  barkis  carrying his eyes back to his horse’s ears 
 that man’s been a-waitin  for a answer ever since  

 have you told her so  mr  barkis  

 no  no   growled mr  barkis  reflecting about it   i ain’t got no call
to go and tell her so  i never said six words to her myself  i ain’t
a-goin  to tell her so  

 would you like me to do it  mr  barkis   said i  doubtfully   you might
tell her  if you would   said mr  barkis  with another slow look at me 
 that barkis was a-waitin  for a answer  says you  what name is it  

 her name  

 ah   said mr  barkis  with a nod of his head 

 peggotty  

 chrisen name  or nat’ral name   said mr  barkis 

 oh  it’s not her christian name  her christian name is clara  

 is it though   said mr  barkis 

he seemed to find an immense fund of reflection in this circumstance 
and sat pondering and inwardly whistling for some time 

 well   he resumed at length   says you   peggotty  barkis is waitin 
for a answer   says she  perhaps   answer to what   says you   to what i
told you    what is that   says she   barkis is willin    says you  

this extremely artful suggestion mr  barkis accompanied with a nudge
of his elbow that gave me quite a stitch in my side  after that  he
slouched over his horse in his usual manner  and made no other reference
to the subject except  half an hour afterwards  taking a piece of chalk
from his pocket  and writing up  inside the tilt of the cart   clara
peggotty   apparently as a private memorandum 

ah  what a strange feeling it was to be going home when it was not home 
and to find that every object i looked at  reminded me of the happy old
home  which was like a dream i could never dream again  the days when my
mother and i and peggotty were all in all to one another  and there was
no one to come between us  rose up before me so sorrowfully on the road 
that i am not sure i was glad to be there  not sure but that i would
rather have remained away  and forgotten it in steerforth’s company  but
there i was  and soon i was at our house  where the bare old elm-trees
wrung their many hands in the bleak wintry air  and shreds of the old
rooks  nests drifted away upon the wind 

the carrier put my box down at the garden-gate  and left me  i walked
along the path towards the house  glancing at the windows  and fearing
at every step to see mr  murdstone or miss murdstone lowering out of
one of them  no face appeared  however  and being come to the house  and
knowing how to open the door  before dark  without knocking  i went in
with a quiet  timid step 

god knows how infantine the memory may have been  that was awakened
within me by the sound of my mother’s voice in the old parlour  when i
set foot in the hall  she was singing in a low tone  i think i must have
lain in her arms  and heard her singing so to me when i was but a baby 
the strain was new to me  and yet it was so old that it filled my heart
brim-full  like a friend come back from a long absence 

i believed  from the solitary and thoughtful way in which my mother
murmured her song  that she was alone  and i went softly into the room 
she was sitting by the fire  suckling an infant  whose tiny hand she
held against her neck  her eyes were looking down upon its face  and she
sat singing to it  i was so far right  that she had no other companion 

i spoke to her  and she started  and cried out  but seeing me  she
called me her dear davy  her own boy  and coming half across the room
to meet me  kneeled down upon the ground and kissed me  and laid my head
down on her bosom near the little creature that was nestling there  and
put its hand to my lips 

i wish i had died  i wish i had died then  with that feeling in my
heart  i should have been more fit for heaven than i ever have been
since 

 he is your brother   said my mother  fondling me   davy  my pretty boy 
my poor child   then she kissed me more and more  and clasped me round
the neck  this she was doing when peggotty came running in  and bounced
down on the ground beside us  and went mad about us both for a quarter
of an hour 

it seemed that i had not been expected so soon  the carrier being much
before his usual time  it seemed  too  that mr  and miss murdstone had
gone out upon a visit in the neighbourhood  and would not return before
night  i had never hoped for this  i had never thought it possible that
we three could be together undisturbed  once more  and i felt  for the
time  as if the old days were come back 

we dined together by the fireside  peggotty was in attendance to wait
upon us  but my mother wouldn’t let her do it  and made her dine with
us  i had my own old plate  with a brown view of a man-of-war in full
sail upon it  which peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time i
had been away  and would not have had broken  she said  for a hundred
pounds  i had my own old mug with david on it  and my own old little
knife and fork that wouldn’t cut 

while we were at table  i thought it a favourable occasion to tell
peggotty about mr  barkis  who  before i had finished what i had to tell
her  began to laugh  and throw her apron over her face 

 peggotty   said my mother   what’s the matter  

peggotty only laughed the more  and held her apron tight over her face
when my mother tried to pull it away  and sat as if her head were in a
bag 

 what are you doing  you stupid creature   said my mother  laughing 

 oh  drat the man   cried peggotty   he wants to marry me  

 it would be a very good match for you  wouldn’t it   said my mother 

 oh  i don’t know   said peggotty   don’t ask me  i wouldn’t have him if
he was made of gold  nor i wouldn’t have anybody  

 then  why don’t you tell him so  you ridiculous thing   said my mother 

 tell him so   retorted peggotty  looking out of her apron   he has
never said a word to me about it  he knows better  if he was to make so
bold as say a word to me  i should slap his face  

her own was as red as ever i saw it  or any other face  i think  but she
only covered it again  for a few moments at a time  when she was taken
with a violent fit of laughter  and after two or three of those attacks 
went on with her dinner 

i remarked that my mother  though she smiled when peggotty looked at
her  became more serious and thoughtful  i had seen at first that she
was changed  her face was very pretty still  but it looked careworn  and
too delicate  and her hand was so thin and white that it seemed to me
to be almost transparent  but the change to which i now refer was
superadded to this  it was in her manner  which became anxious and
fluttered  at last she said  putting out her hand  and laying it
affectionately on the hand of her old servant 

 peggotty  dear  you are not going to be married  

 me  ma’am   returned peggotty  staring   lord bless you  no  

 not just yet   said my mother  tenderly 

 never   cried peggotty 

my mother took her hand  and said 

 don’t leave me  peggotty  stay with me  it will not be for long 
perhaps  what should i ever do without you  

 me leave you  my precious   cried peggotty   not for all the world and
his wife  why  what’s put that in your silly little head    for peggotty
had been used of old to talk to my mother sometimes like a child 

but my mother made no answer  except to thank her  and peggotty went
running on in her own fashion 

 me leave you  i think i see myself  peggotty go away from you  i should
like to catch her at it  no  no  no   said peggotty  shaking her head 
and folding her arms   not she  my dear  it isn’t that there ain’t some
cats that would be well enough pleased if she did  but they sha’n’t be
pleased  they shall be aggravated  i’ll stay with you till i am a cross
cranky old woman  and when i’m too deaf  and too lame  and too blind 
and too mumbly for want of teeth  to be of any use at all  even to be
found fault with  than i shall go to my davy  and ask him to take me
in  

 and  peggotty   says i   i shall be glad to see you  and i’ll make you
as welcome as a queen  

 bless your dear heart   cried peggotty   i know you will   and she
kissed me beforehand  in grateful acknowledgement of my hospitality 
after that  she covered her head up with her apron again and had another
laugh about mr  barkis  after that  she took the baby out of its little
cradle  and nursed it  after that  she cleared the dinner table 
after that  came in with another cap on  and her work-box  and the
yard-measure  and the bit of wax-candle  all just the same as ever 

we sat round the fire  and talked delightfully  i told them what a hard
master mr  creakle was  and they pitied me very much  i told them what a
fine fellow steerforth was  and what a patron of mine  and peggotty said
she would walk a score of miles to see him  i took the little baby in
my arms when it was awake  and nursed it lovingly  when it was asleep
again  i crept close to my mother’s side according to my old custom 
broken now a long time  and sat with my arms embracing her waist  and my
little red cheek on her shoulder  and once more felt her beautiful
hair drooping over me  like an angel’s wing as i used to think  i
recollect  and was very happy indeed 

while i sat thus  looking at the fire  and seeing pictures in the
red-hot coals  i almost believed that i had never been away  that mr 
and miss murdstone were such pictures  and would vanish when the fire
got low  and that there was nothing real in all that i remembered  save
my mother  peggotty  and i 

peggotty darned away at a stocking as long as she could see  and then
sat with it drawn on her left hand like a glove  and her needle in her
right  ready to take another stitch whenever there was a blaze  i cannot
conceive whose stockings they can have been that peggotty was always
darning  or where such an unfailing supply of stockings in want of
darning can have come from  from my earliest infancy she seems to have
been always employed in that class of needlework  and never by any
chance in any other 

 i wonder   said peggotty  who was sometimes seized with a fit of
wondering on some most unexpected topic   what’s become of davy’s
great-aunt    lor  peggotty   observed my mother  rousing herself from a
reverie   what nonsense you talk  

 well  but i really do wonder  ma’am   said peggotty 

 what can have put such a person in your head   inquired my mother   is
there nobody else in the world to come there  

 i don’t know how it is   said peggotty   unless it’s on account of
being stupid  but my head never can pick and choose its people  they
come and they go  and they don’t come and they don’t go  just as they
like  i wonder what’s become of her  

 how absurd you are  peggotty   returned my mother   one would suppose
you wanted a second visit from her  

 lord forbid   cried peggotty 

 well then  don’t talk about such uncomfortable things  there’s a good
soul   said my mother   miss betsey is shut up in her cottage by the
sea  no doubt  and will remain there  at all events  she is not likely
ever to trouble us again  

 no   mused peggotty   no  that ain’t likely at all    i wonder  if she
was to die  whether she’d leave davy anything  

 good gracious me  peggotty   returned my mother   what a nonsensical
woman you are  when you know that she took offence at the poor dear
boy’s ever being born at all  

 i suppose she wouldn’t be inclined to forgive him now   hinted
peggotty 

 why should she be inclined to forgive him now   said my mother  rather
sharply 

 now that he’s got a brother  i mean   said peggotty 

my mother immediately began to cry  and wondered how peggotty dared to
say such a thing 

 as if this poor little innocent in its cradle had ever done any harm to
you or anybody else  you jealous thing   said she   you had much better
go and marry mr  barkis  the carrier  why don’t you  

 i should make miss murdstone happy  if i was to   said peggotty 

 what a bad disposition you have  peggotty   returned my mother   you
are as jealous of miss murdstone as it is possible for a ridiculous
creature to be  you want to keep the keys yourself  and give out all the
things  i suppose  i shouldn’t be surprised if you did  when you know
that she only does it out of kindness and the best intentions  you know
she does  peggotty  you know it well  

peggotty muttered something to the effect of  bother the best
intentions   and something else to the effect that there was a little
too much of the best intentions going on 

 i know what you mean  you cross thing   said my mother   i understand
you  peggotty  perfectly  you know i do  and i wonder you don’t colour
up like fire  but one point at a time  miss murdstone is the point now 
peggotty  and you sha’n’t escape from it  haven’t you heard her
say  over and over again  that she thinks i am too thoughtless and
too  a  a   

 pretty   suggested peggotty 

 well   returned my mother  half laughing   and if she is so silly as to
say so  can i be blamed for it  

 no one says you can   said peggotty 

 no  i should hope not  indeed   returned my mother   haven’t you heard
her say  over and over again  that on this account she wished to spare
me a great deal of trouble  which she thinks i am not suited for  and
which i really don’t know myself that i am suited for  and isn’t she up
early and late  and going to and fro continually  and doesn’t she do
all sorts of things  and grope into all sorts of places  coal-holes and
pantries and i don’t know where  that can’t be very agreeable  and do
you mean to insinuate that there is not a sort of devotion in that  

 i don’t insinuate at all   said peggotty 

 you do  peggotty   returned my mother   you never do anything else 
except your work  you are always insinuating  you revel in it  and when
you talk of mr  murdstone’s good intentions   

 i never talked of  em   said peggotty 

 no  peggotty   returned my mother   but you insinuated  that’s what i
told you just now  that’s the worst of you  you will insinuate  i said 
at the moment  that i understood you  and you see i did  when you talk
of mr  murdstone’s good intentions  and pretend to slight them  for i
don’t believe you really do  in your heart  peggotty   you must be as
well convinced as i am how good they are  and how they actuate him in
everything  if he seems to have been at all stern with a certain person 
peggotty  you understand  and so i am sure does davy  that i am not
alluding to anybody present  it is solely because he is satisfied that
it is for a certain person’s benefit  he naturally loves a certain
person  on my account  and acts solely for a certain person’s good  he
is better able to judge of it than i am  for i very well know that i am
a weak  light  girlish creature  and that he is a firm  grave  serious
man  and he takes   said my mother  with the tears which were engendered
in her affectionate nature  stealing down her face   he takes great
pains with me  and i ought to be very thankful to him  and very
submissive to him even in my thoughts  and when i am not  peggotty  i
worry and condemn myself  and feel doubtful of my own heart  and don’t
know what to do  

peggotty sat with her chin on the foot of the stocking  looking silently
at the fire 

 there  peggotty   said my mother  changing her tone   don’t let us fall
out with one another  for i couldn’t bear it  you are my true friend  i
know  if i have any in the world  when i call you a ridiculous creature 
or a vexatious thing  or anything of that sort  peggotty  i only mean
that you are my true friend  and always have been  ever since the night
when mr  copperfield first brought me home here  and you came out to the
gate to meet me  

peggotty was not slow to respond  and ratify the treaty of friendship by
giving me one of her best hugs  i think i had some glimpses of the real
character of this conversation at the time  but i am sure  now  that
the good creature originated it  and took her part in it  merely that
my mother might comfort herself with the little contradictory summary in
which she had indulged  the design was efficacious  for i remember that
my mother seemed more at ease during the rest of the evening  and that
peggotty observed her less 

when we had had our tea  and the ashes were thrown up  and the candles
snuffed  i read peggotty a chapter out of the crocodile book  in
remembrance of old times  she took it out of her pocket  i don’t know
whether she had kept it there ever since  and then we talked about salem
house  which brought me round again to steerforth  who was my great
subject  we were very happy  and that evening  as the last of its race 
and destined evermore to close that volume of my life  will never pass
out of my memory 

it was almost ten o’clock before we heard the sound of wheels  we all
got up then  and my mother said hurriedly that  as it was so late  and
mr  and miss murdstone approved of early hours for young people  perhaps
i had better go to bed  i kissed her  and went upstairs with my candle
directly  before they came in  it appeared to my childish fancy  as i
ascended to the bedroom where i had been imprisoned  that they brought
a cold blast of air into the house which blew away the old familiar
feeling like a feather 

i felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast in the morning  as
i had never set eyes on mr  murdstone since the day when i committed my
memorable offence  however  as it must be done  i went down  after two
or three false starts half-way  and as many runs back on tiptoe to my
own room  and presented myself in the parlour 

he was standing before the fire with his back to it  while miss
murdstone made the tea  he looked at me steadily as i entered  but made
no sign of recognition whatever  i went up to him  after a moment of
confusion  and said   i beg your pardon  sir  i am very sorry for what i
did  and i hope you will forgive me  

 i am glad to hear you are sorry  david   he replied 

the hand he gave me was the hand i had bitten  i could not restrain my
eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it  but it was not so
red as i turned  when i met that sinister expression in his face 

 how do you do  ma’am   i said to miss murdstone 

 ah  dear me   sighed miss murdstone  giving me the tea-caddy scoop
instead of her fingers   how long are the holidays  

 a month  ma’am  

 counting from when  

 from today  ma’am  

 oh   said miss murdstone   then here’s one day off  

she kept a calendar of the holidays in this way  and every morning
checked a day off in exactly the same manner  she did it gloomily until
she came to ten  but when she got into two figures she became more
hopeful  and  as the time advanced  even jocular 

it was on this very first day that i had the misfortune to throw her 
though she was not subject to such weakness in general  into a state of
violent consternation  i came into the room where she and my mother
were sitting  and the baby  who was only a few weeks old  being on
my mother’s lap  i took it very carefully in my arms  suddenly miss
murdstone gave such a scream that i all but dropped it 

 my dear jane   cried my mother 

 good heavens  clara  do you see   exclaimed miss murdstone 

 see what  my dear jane   said my mother   where  

 he’s got it   cried miss murdstone   the boy has got the baby  

she was limp with horror  but stiffened herself to make a dart at me 
and take it out of my arms  then  she turned faint  and was so very
ill that they were obliged to give her cherry brandy  i was solemnly
interdicted by her  on her recovery  from touching my brother any more
on any pretence whatever  and my poor mother  who  i could see  wished
otherwise  meekly confirmed the interdict  by saying   no doubt you are
right  my dear jane  

on another occasion  when we three were together  this same dear
baby  it was truly dear to me  for our mother’s sake  was the innocent
occasion of miss murdstone’s going into a passion  my mother  who had
been looking at its eyes as it lay upon her lap  said 

 davy  come here   and looked at mine 

i saw miss murdstone lay her beads down 

 i declare   said my mother  gently   they are exactly alike  i suppose
they are mine  i think they are the colour of mine  but they are
wonderfully alike  

 what are you talking about  clara   said miss murdstone 

 my dear jane   faltered my mother  a little abashed by the harsh tone
of this inquiry   i find that the baby’s eyes and davy’s are exactly
alike  

 clara   said miss murdstone  rising angrily   you are a positive fool
sometimes  

 my dear jane   remonstrated my mother 

 a positive fool   said miss murdstone   who else could compare my
brother’s baby with your boy  they are not at all alike  they are
exactly unlike  they are utterly dissimilar in all respects  i hope
they will ever remain so  i will not sit here  and hear such comparisons
made   with that she stalked out  and made the door bang after her 

in short  i was not a favourite with miss murdstone  in short  i was not
a favourite there with anybody  not even with myself  for those who did
like me could not show it  and those who did not  showed it so plainly
that i had a sensitive consciousness of always appearing constrained 
boorish  and dull 

i felt that i made them as uncomfortable as they made me  if i came into
the room where they were  and they were talking together and my mother
seemed cheerful  an anxious cloud would steal over her face from the
moment of my entrance  if mr  murdstone were in his best humour  i
checked him  if miss murdstone were in her worst  i intensified it  i
had perception enough to know that my mother was the victim always  that
she was afraid to speak to me or to be kind to me  lest she should
give them some offence by her manner of doing so  and receive a
lecture afterwards  that she was not only ceaselessly afraid of her own
offending  but of my offending  and uneasily watched their looks if i
only moved  therefore i resolved to keep myself as much out of their way
as i could  and many a wintry hour did i hear the church clock strike 
when i was sitting in my cheerless bedroom  wrapped in my little
great-coat  poring over a book 

in the evening  sometimes  i went and sat with peggotty in the kitchen 
there i was comfortable  and not afraid of being myself  but neither of
these resources was approved of in the parlour  the tormenting humour
which was dominant there stopped them both  i was still held to be
necessary to my poor mother’s training  and  as one of her trials  could
not be suffered to absent myself 

 david   said mr  murdstone  one day after dinner when i was going to
leave the room as usual   i am sorry to observe that you are of a sullen
disposition  

 as sulky as a bear   said miss murdstone 

i stood still  and hung my head 

 now  david   said mr  murdstone   a sullen obdurate disposition is  of
all tempers  the worst  

 and the boy’s is  of all such dispositions that ever i have seen  
remarked his sister   the most confirmed and stubborn  i think  my dear
clara  even you must observe it  

 i beg your pardon  my dear jane   said my mother   but are you quite
sure  i am certain you’ll excuse me  my dear jane  that you understand
davy  

 i should be somewhat ashamed of myself  clara   returned miss
murdstone   if i could not understand the boy  or any boy  i don’t
profess to be profound  but i do lay claim to common sense  

 no doubt  my dear jane   returned my mother   your understanding is
very vigorous   

 oh dear  no  pray don’t say that  clara   interposed miss murdstone 
angrily 

 but i am sure it is   resumed my mother   and everybody knows it is  i
profit so much by it myself  in many ways  at least i ought to  that no
one can be more convinced of it than myself  and therefore i speak with
great diffidence  my dear jane  i assure you  

 we’ll say i don’t understand the boy  clara   returned miss murdstone 
arranging the little fetters on her wrists   we’ll agree  if you please 
that i don’t understand him at all  he is much too deep for me  but
perhaps my brother’s penetration may enable him to have some insight
into his character  and i believe my brother was speaking on the subject
when we  not very decently  interrupted him  

 i think  clara   said mr  murdstone  in a low grave voice   that there
may be better and more dispassionate judges of such a question than
you  

 edward   replied my mother  timidly   you are a far better judge of all
questions than i pretend to be  both you and jane are  i only said   

 you only said something weak and inconsiderate   he replied   try not
to do it again  my dear clara  and keep a watch upon yourself  

my mother’s lips moved  as if she answered  yes  my dear edward   but
she said nothing aloud 

 i was sorry  david  i remarked   said mr  murdstone  turning his head
and his eyes stiffly towards me   to observe that you are of a sullen
disposition  this is not a character that i can suffer to develop itself
beneath my eyes without an effort at improvement  you must endeavour 
sir  to change it  we must endeavour to change it for you  

 i beg your pardon  sir   i faltered   i have never meant to be sullen
since i came back  

 don’t take refuge in a lie  sir   he returned so fiercely  that i saw
my mother involuntarily put out her trembling hand as if to interpose
between us   you have withdrawn yourself in your sullenness to your own
room  you have kept your own room when you ought to have been here  you
know now  once for all  that i require you to be here  and not there 
further  that i require you to bring obedience here  you know me  david 
i will have it done  

miss murdstone gave a hoarse chuckle 

 i will have a respectful  prompt  and ready bearing towards myself   he
continued   and towards jane murdstone  and towards your mother  i will
not have this room shunned as if it were infected  at the pleasure of a
child  sit down  

he ordered me like a dog  and i obeyed like a dog 

 one thing more   he said   i observe that you have an attachment to low
and common company  you are not to associate with servants  the
kitchen will not improve you  in the many respects in which you need
improvement  of the woman who abets you  i say nothing  since you 
clara   addressing my mother in a lower voice   from old associations
and long-established fancies  have a weakness respecting her which is
not yet overcome  

 a most unaccountable delusion it is   cried miss murdstone 

 i only say   he resumed  addressing me   that i disapprove of your
preferring such company as mistress peggotty  and that it is to be
abandoned  now  david  you understand me  and you know what will be the
consequence if you fail to obey me to the letter  

i knew well  better perhaps than he thought  as far as my poor mother
was concerned  and i obeyed him to the letter  i retreated to my own
room no more  i took refuge with peggotty no more  but sat wearily in
the parlour day after day  looking forward to night  and bedtime 

what irksome constraint i underwent  sitting in the same attitude hours
upon hours  afraid to move an arm or a leg lest miss murdstone should
complain  as she did on the least pretence  of my restlessness  and
afraid to move an eye lest she should light on some look of dislike
or scrutiny that would find new cause for complaint in mine  what
intolerable dulness to sit listening to the ticking of the clock  and
watching miss murdstone’s little shiny steel beads as she strung them 
and wondering whether she would ever be married  and if so  to what
sort of unhappy man  and counting the divisions in the moulding of the
chimney-piece  and wandering away  with my eyes  to the ceiling  among
the curls and corkscrews in the paper on the wall 

what walks i took alone  down muddy lanes  in the bad winter weather 
carrying that parlour  and mr  and miss murdstone in it  everywhere  a
monstrous load that i was obliged to bear  a daymare that there was
no possibility of breaking in  a weight that brooded on my wits  and
blunted them 

what meals i had in silence and embarrassment  always feeling that there
were a knife and fork too many  and that mine  an appetite too many  and
that mine  a plate and chair too many  and those mine  a somebody too
many  and that i 

what evenings  when the candles came  and i was expected to employ
myself  but  not daring to read an entertaining book  pored over some
hard-headed  harder-hearted treatise on arithmetic  when the tables of
weights and measures set themselves to tunes  as  rule britannia   or
 away with melancholy   when they wouldn’t stand still to be learnt  but
would go threading my grandmother’s needle through my unfortunate head 
in at one ear and out at the other  what yawns and dozes i lapsed into 
in spite of all my care  what starts i came out of concealed sleeps
with  what answers i never got  to little observations that i rarely
made  what a blank space i seemed  which everybody overlooked  and
yet was in everybody’s way  what a heavy relief it was to hear miss
murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at night  and order me to bed 

thus the holidays lagged away  until the morning came when miss
murdstone said   here’s the last day off   and gave me the closing cup
of tea of the vacation 

i was not sorry to go  i had lapsed into a stupid state  but i was
recovering a little and looking forward to steerforth  albeit mr 
creakle loomed behind him  again mr  barkis appeared at the gate  and
again miss murdstone in her warning voice  said   clara   when my mother
bent over me  to bid me farewell 

i kissed her  and my baby brother  and was very sorry then  but not
sorry to go away  for the gulf between us was there  and the parting was
there  every day  and it is not so much the embrace she gave me  that
lives in my mind  though it was as fervent as could be  as what followed
the embrace 

i was in the carrier’s cart when i heard her calling to me  i looked
out  and she stood at the garden-gate alone  holding her baby up in her
arms for me to see  it was cold still weather  and not a hair of her
head  nor a fold of her dress  was stirred  as she looked intently at
me  holding up her child 

so i lost her  so i saw her afterwards  in my sleep at school  a silent
presence near my bed  looking at me with the same intent face  holding
up her baby in her arms 



chapter 9  i have a memorable birthday


i pass over all that happened at school  until the anniversary of my
birthday came round in march  except that steerforth was more to be
admired than ever  i remember nothing  he was going away at the end of
the half-year  if not sooner  and was more spirited and independent than
before in my eyes  and therefore more engaging than before  but beyond
this i remember nothing  the great remembrance by which that time is
marked in my mind  seems to have swallowed up all lesser recollections 
and to exist alone 

it is even difficult for me to believe that there was a gap of full
two months between my return to salem house and the arrival of that
birthday  i can only understand that the fact was so  because i know it
must have been so  otherwise i should feel convinced that there was no
interval  and that the one occasion trod upon the other’s heels 

how well i recollect the kind of day it was  i smell the fog that hung
about the place  i see the hoar frost  ghostly  through it  i feel my
rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek  i look along the dim perspective of
the schoolroom  with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the
foggy morning  and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the
raw cold as they blow upon their fingers  and tap their feet upon the
floor  it was after breakfast  and we had been summoned in from the
playground  when mr  sharp entered and said 

 david copperfield is to go into the parlour  

i expected a hamper from peggotty  and brightened at the order  some
of the boys about me put in their claim not to be forgotten in the
distribution of the good things  as i got out of my seat with great
alacrity 

 don’t hurry  david   said mr  sharp   there’s time enough  my boy 
don’t hurry  

i might have been surprised by the feeling tone in which he spoke  if i
had given it a thought  but i gave it none until afterwards  i hurried
away to the parlour  and there i found mr  creakle  sitting at his
breakfast with the cane and a newspaper before him  and mrs  creakle
with an opened letter in her hand  but no hamper 

 david copperfield   said mrs  creakle  leading me to a sofa  and
sitting down beside me   i want to speak to you very particularly  i
have something to tell you  my child  

mr  creakle  at whom of course i looked  shook his head without looking
at me  and stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast 

 you are too young to know how the world changes every day   said mrs 
creakle   and how the people in it pass away  but we all have to learn
it  david  some of us when we are young  some of us when we are old 
some of us at all times of our lives  

i looked at her earnestly 

 when you came away from home at the end of the vacation   said mrs 
creakle  after a pause   were they all well   after another pause   was
your mama well  

i trembled without distinctly knowing why  and still looked at her
earnestly  making no attempt to answer 

 because   said she   i grieve to tell you that i hear this morning your
mama is very ill  

a mist rose between mrs  creakle and me  and her figure seemed to move
in it for an instant  then i felt the burning tears run down my face 
and it was steady again 

 she is very dangerously ill   she added 

i knew all now 

 she is dead  

there was no need to tell me so  i had already broken out into a
desolate cry  and felt an orphan in the wide world 

she was very kind to me  she kept me there all day  and left me alone
sometimes  and i cried  and wore myself to sleep  and awoke and
cried again  when i could cry no more  i began to think  and then the
oppression on my breast was heaviest  and my grief a dull pain that
there was no ease for 

and yet my thoughts were idle  not intent on the calamity that weighed
upon my heart  but idly loitering near it  i thought of our house shut
up and hushed  i thought of the little baby  who  mrs  creakle said  had
been pining away for some time  and who  they believed  would die too  i
thought of my father’s grave in the churchyard  by our house  and of my
mother lying there beneath the tree i knew so well  i stood upon a chair
when i was left alone  and looked into the glass to see how red my eyes
were  and how sorrowful my face  i considered  after some hours were
gone  if my tears were really hard to flow now  as they seemed to be 
what  in connexion with my loss  it would affect me most to think
of when i drew near home  for i was going home to the funeral  i am
sensible of having felt that a dignity attached to me among the rest of
the boys  and that i was important in my affliction 

if ever child were stricken with sincere grief  i was  but i remember
that this importance was a kind of satisfaction to me  when i walked in
the playground that afternoon while the boys were in school  when i
saw them glancing at me out of the windows  as they went up to their
classes  i felt distinguished  and looked more melancholy  and walked
slower  when school was over  and they came out and spoke to me  i felt
it rather good in myself not to be proud to any of them  and to take
exactly the same notice of them all  as before 

i was to go home next night  not by the mail  but by the heavy
night-coach  which was called the farmer  and was principally used by
country-people travelling short intermediate distances upon the road  we
had no story-telling that evening  and traddles insisted on lending me
his pillow  i don’t know what good he thought it would do me  for i
had one of my own  but it was all he had to lend  poor fellow  except a
sheet of letter-paper full of skeletons  and that he gave me at parting 
as a soother of my sorrows and a contribution to my peace of mind 

i left salem house upon the morrow afternoon  i little thought then that
i left it  never to return  we travelled very slowly all night  and
did not get into yarmouth before nine or ten o’clock in the morning  i
looked out for mr  barkis  but he was not there  and instead of him a
fat  short-winded  merry-looking  little old man in black  with rusty
little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches  black stockings 
and a broad-brimmed hat  came puffing up to the coach window  and said 

 master copperfield  

 yes  sir  

 will you come with me  young sir  if you please   he said  opening the
door   and i shall have the pleasure of taking you home  

i put my hand in his  wondering who he was  and we walked away to a
shop in a narrow street  on which was written omer  draper  tailor 
haberdasher  funeral furnisher   c  it was a close and stifling little
shop  full of all sorts of clothing  made and unmade  including
one window full of beaver-hats and bonnets  we went into a little
back-parlour behind the shop  where we found three young women at work
on a quantity of black materials  which were heaped upon the table 
and little bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor 
there was a good fire in the room  and a breathless smell of warm black
crape  i did not know what the smell was then  but i know now 

the three young women  who appeared to be very industrious and
comfortable  raised their heads to look at me  and then went on with
their work  stitch  stitch  stitch  at the same time there came from
a workshop across a little yard outside the window  a regular sound
of hammering that kept a kind of tune  rat  tat-tat  rat  tat-tat 
rat  tat-tat  without any variation 

 well   said my conductor to one of the three young women   how do you
get on  minnie  

 we shall be ready by the trying-on time   she replied gaily  without
looking up   don’t you be afraid  father  

mr  omer took off his broad-brimmed hat  and sat down and panted  he was
so fat that he was obliged to pant some time before he could say 

 that’s right  

 father   said minnie  playfully   what a porpoise you do grow  

 well  i don’t know how it is  my dear   he replied  considering about
it   i am rather so  

 you are such a comfortable man  you see   said minnie   you take things
so easy  

 no use taking  em otherwise  my dear   said mr  omer 

 no  indeed   returned his daughter   we are all pretty gay here  thank
heaven  ain’t we  father  

 i hope so  my dear   said mr  omer   as i have got my breath now  i
think i’ll measure this young scholar  would you walk into the shop 
master copperfield  

i preceded mr  omer  in compliance with his request  and after showing
me a roll of cloth which he said was extra super  and too good mourning
for anything short of parents  he took my various dimensions  and put
them down in a book  while he was recording them he called my attention
to his stock in trade  and to certain fashions which he said had  just
come up   and to certain other fashions which he said had  just gone
out  

 and by that sort of thing we very often lose a little mint of money  
said mr  omer   but fashions are like human beings  they come in  nobody
knows when  why  or how  and they go out  nobody knows when  why  or
how  everything is like life  in my opinion  if you look at it in that
point of view  

i was too sorrowful to discuss the question  which would possibly have
been beyond me under any circumstances  and mr  omer took me back into
the parlour  breathing with some difficulty on the way 

he then called down a little break-neck range of steps behind a door 
 bring up that tea and bread-and-butter   which  after some time 
during which i sat looking about me and thinking  and listening to the
stitching in the room and the tune that was being hammered across the
yard  appeared on a tray  and turned out to be for me 

 i have been acquainted with you   said mr  omer  after watching me
for some minutes  during which i had not made much impression on the
breakfast  for the black things destroyed my appetite   i have been
acquainted with you a long time  my young friend  

 have you  sir  

 all your life   said mr  omer   i may say before it  i knew your
father before you  he was five foot nine and a half  and he lays in
five-and-twen-ty foot of ground  

 rat  tat-tat  rat  tat-tat  rat  tat-tat   across the yard 

 he lays in five and twen-ty foot of ground  if he lays in a fraction  
said mr  omer  pleasantly   it was either his request or her direction 
i forget which  

 do you know how my little brother is  sir   i inquired 

mr  omer shook his head 

 rat  tat-tat  rat  tat-tat  rat  tat-tat  

 he is in his mother’s arms   said he 

 oh  poor little fellow  is he dead  

 don’t mind it more than you can help   said mr  omer   yes  the baby’s
dead  

my wounds broke out afresh at this intelligence  i left the
scarcely-tasted breakfast  and went and rested my head on another table 
in a corner of the little room  which minnie hastily cleared  lest i
should spot the mourning that was lying there with my tears  she was
a pretty  good-natured girl  and put my hair away from my eyes with a
soft  kind touch  but she was very cheerful at having nearly finished
her work and being in good time  and was so different from me 

presently the tune left off  and a good-looking young fellow came across
the yard into the room  he had a hammer in his hand  and his mouth was
full of little nails  which he was obliged to take out before he could
speak 

 well  joram   said mr  omer   how do you get on  

 all right   said joram   done  sir  

minnie coloured a little  and the other two girls smiled at one another 

 what  you were at it by candle-light last night  when i was at the
club  then  were you   said mr  omer  shutting up one eye 

 yes   said joram   as you said we could make a little trip of it  and
go over together  if it was done  minnie and me  and you  

 oh  i thought you were going to leave me out altogether   said mr 
omer  laughing till he coughed 

   as you was so good as to say that   resumed the young man   why i
turned to with a will  you see  will you give me your opinion of it  

 i will   said mr  omer  rising   my dear   and he stopped and turned to
me   would you like to see your   

 no  father   minnie interposed 

 i thought it might be agreeable  my dear   said mr  omer   but perhaps
you’re right  

i can’t say how i knew it was my dear  dear mother’s coffin that they
went to look at  i had never heard one making  i had never seen one that
i know of   but it came into my mind what the noise was  while it was
going on  and when the young man entered  i am sure i knew what he had
been doing 

the work being now finished  the two girls  whose names i had not heard 
brushed the shreds and threads from their dresses  and went into the
shop to put that to rights  and wait for customers  minnie stayed behind
to fold up what they had made  and pack it in two baskets  this she did
upon her knees  humming a lively little tune the while  joram  who i had
no doubt was her lover  came in and stole a kiss from her while she was
busy  he didn’t appear to mind me  at all   and said her father was gone
for the chaise  and he must make haste and get himself ready  then he
went out again  and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket 
and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her
gown  and put on her outer clothing smartly  at a little glass behind
the door  in which i saw the reflection of her pleased face 

all this i observed  sitting at the table in the corner with my head
leaning on my hand  and my thoughts running on very different things 
the chaise soon came round to the front of the shop  and the baskets
being put in first  i was put in next  and those three followed  i
remember it as a kind of half chaise-cart  half pianoforte-van  painted
of a sombre colour  and drawn by a black horse with a long tail  there
was plenty of room for us all 

i do not think i have ever experienced so strange a feeling in my life
 i am wiser now  perhaps  as that of being with them  remembering how
they had been employed  and seeing them enjoy the ride  i was not angry
with them  i was more afraid of them  as if i were cast away among
creatures with whom i had no community of nature  they were very
cheerful  the old man sat in front to drive  and the two young people
sat behind him  and whenever he spoke to them leaned forward  the one on
one side of his chubby face and the other on the other  and made a great
deal of him  they would have talked to me too  but i held back  and
moped in my corner  scared by their love-making and hilarity  though
it was far from boisterous  and almost wondering that no judgement came
upon them for their hardness of heart 

so  when they stopped to bait the horse  and ate and drank and enjoyed
themselves  i could touch nothing that they touched  but kept my fast
unbroken  so  when we reached home  i dropped out of the chaise behind 
as quickly as possible  that i might not be in their company before
those solemn windows  looking blindly on me like closed eyes once
bright  and oh  how little need i had had to think what would move me to
tears when i came back  seeing the window of my mother’s room  and next
it that which  in the better time  was mine 

i was in peggotty’s arms before i got to the door  and she took me into
the house  her grief burst out when she first saw me  but she controlled
it soon  and spoke in whispers  and walked softly  as if the dead could
be disturbed  she had not been in bed  i found  for a long time  she
sat up at night still  and watched  as long as her poor dear pretty was
above the ground  she said  she would never desert her 

mr  murdstone took no heed of me when i went into the parlour where he
was  but sat by the fireside  weeping silently  and pondering in his
elbow-chair  miss murdstone  who was busy at her writing-desk  which
was covered with letters and papers  gave me her cold finger-nails  and
asked me  in an iron whisper  if i had been measured for my mourning 

i said   yes  

 and your shirts   said miss murdstone   have you brought  em home  

 yes  ma’am  i have brought home all my clothes  

this was all the consolation that her firmness administered to me  i do
not doubt that she had a choice pleasure in exhibiting what she called
her self-command  and her firmness  and her strength of mind  and
her common sense  and the whole diabolical catalogue of her unamiable
qualities  on such an occasion  she was particularly proud of her turn
for business  and she showed it now in reducing everything to pen and
ink  and being moved by nothing  all the rest of that day  and from
morning to night afterwards  she sat at that desk  scratching composedly
with a hard pen  speaking in the same imperturbable whisper to
everybody  never relaxing a muscle of her face  or softening a tone of
her voice  or appearing with an atom of her dress astray 

her brother took a book sometimes  but never read it that i saw  he
would open it and look at it as if he were reading  but would remain for
a whole hour without turning the leaf  and then put it down and walk to
and fro in the room  i used to sit with folded hands watching him  and
counting his footsteps  hour after hour  he very seldom spoke to her 
and never to me  he seemed to be the only restless thing  except the
clocks  in the whole motionless house 

in these days before the funeral  i saw but little of peggotty  except
that  in passing up or down stairs  i always found her close to the room
where my mother and her baby lay  and except that she came to me every
night  and sat by my bed’s head while i went to sleep  a day or
two before the burial  i think it was a day or two before  but i am
conscious of confusion in my mind about that heavy time  with nothing
to mark its progress  she took me into the room  i only recollect that
underneath some white covering on the bed  with a beautiful cleanliness
and freshness all around it  there seemed to me to lie embodied the
solemn stillness that was in the house  and that when she would have
turned the cover gently back  i cried   oh no  oh no   and held her
hand 

if the funeral had been yesterday  i could not recollect it better  the
very air of the best parlour  when i went in at the door  the bright
condition of the fire  the shining of the wine in the decanters  the
patterns of the glasses and plates  the faint sweet smell of cake  the
odour of miss murdstone’s dress  and our black clothes  mr  chillip is
in the room  and comes to speak to me 

 and how is master david   he says  kindly 

i cannot tell him very well  i give him my hand  which he holds in his 

 dear me   says mr  chillip  meekly smiling  with something shining in
his eye   our little friends grow up around us  they grow out of our
knowledge  ma’am   this is to miss murdstone  who makes no reply 

 there is a great improvement here  ma’am   says mr  chillip 

miss murdstone merely answers with a frown and a formal bend  mr 
chillip  discomfited  goes into a corner  keeping me with him  and opens
his mouth no more 

i remark this  because i remark everything that happens  not because
i care about myself  or have done since i came home  and now the bell
begins to sound  and mr  omer and another come to make us ready  as
peggotty was wont to tell me  long ago  the followers of my father to
the same grave were made ready in the same room 

there are mr  murdstone  our neighbour mr  grayper  mr  chillip  and
i  when we go out to the door  the bearers and their load are in the
garden  and they move before us down the path  and past the elms  and
through the gate  and into the churchyard  where i have so often heard
the birds sing on a summer morning 

we stand around the grave  the day seems different to me from every
other day  and the light not of the same colour  of a sadder colour 
now there is a solemn hush  which we have brought from home with what is
resting in the mould  and while we stand bareheaded  i hear the voice
of the clergyman  sounding remote in the open air  and yet distinct and
plain  saying   i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  
then i hear sobs  and  standing apart among the lookers-on  i see that
good and faithful servant  whom of all the people upon earth i love the
best  and unto whom my childish heart is certain that the lord will one
day say   well done  

there are many faces that i know  among the little crowd  faces that i
knew in church  when mine was always wondering there  faces that first
saw my mother  when she came to the village in her youthful bloom  i do
not mind them  i mind nothing but my grief  and yet i see and know them
all  and even in the background  far away  see minnie looking on  and
her eye glancing on her sweetheart  who is near me 

it is over  and the earth is filled in  and we turn to come away  before
us stands our house  so pretty and unchanged  so linked in my mind with
the young idea of what is gone  that all my sorrow has been nothing to
the sorrow it calls forth  but they take me on  and mr  chillip talks to
me  and when we get home  puts some water to my lips  and when i ask his
leave to go up to my room  dismisses me with the gentleness of a woman 

all this  i say  is yesterday’s event  events of later date have floated
from me to the shore where all forgotten things will reappear  but this
stands like a high rock in the ocean 

i knew that peggotty would come to me in my room  the sabbath stillness
of the time  the day was so like sunday  i have forgotten that  was
suited to us both  she sat down by my side upon my little bed  and
holding my hand  and sometimes putting it to her lips  and sometimes
smoothing it with hers  as she might have comforted my little brother 
told me  in her way  all that she had to tell concerning what had
happened 

 she was never well   said peggotty   for a long time  she was uncertain
in her mind  and not happy  when her baby was born  i thought at first
she would get better  but she was more delicate  and sunk a little every
day  she used to like to sit alone before her baby came  and then she
cried  but afterwards she used to sing to it  so soft  that i once
thought  when i heard her  it was like a voice up in the air  that was
rising away 

 i think she got to be more timid  and more frightened-like  of late 
and that a hard word was like a blow to her  but she was always the same
to me  she never changed to her foolish peggotty  didn’t my sweet girl  

here peggotty stopped  and softly beat upon my hand a little while 

 the last time that i saw her like her own old self  was the night when
you came home  my dear  the day you went away  she said to me   i never
shall see my pretty darling again  something tells me so  that tells the
truth  i know  

 she tried to hold up after that  and many a time  when they told her
she was thoughtless and light-hearted  made believe to be so  but it was
all a bygone then  she never told her husband what she had told me  she
was afraid of saying it to anybody else  till one night  a little more
than a week before it happened  when she said to him   my dear  i think
i am dying  

  it’s off my mind now  peggotty   she told me  when i laid her in her
bed that night   he will believe it more and more  poor fellow  every
day for a few days to come  and then it will be past  i am very tired 
if this is sleep  sit by me while i sleep  don’t leave me  god bless
both my children  god protect and keep my fatherless boy  

 i never left her afterwards   said peggotty   she often talked to them
two downstairs  for she loved them  she couldn’t bear not to love anyone
who was about her  but when they went away from her bed-side  she always
turned to me  as if there was rest where peggotty was  and never fell
asleep in any other way 

 on the last night  in the evening  she kissed me  and said   if my baby
should die too  peggotty  please let them lay him in my arms  and bury
us together    it was done  for the poor lamb lived but a day beyond
her    let my dearest boy go with us to our resting-place   she said 
 and tell him that his mother  when she lay here  blessed him not once 
but a thousand times   

another silence followed this  and another gentle beating on my hand 

 it was pretty far in the night   said peggotty   when she asked me for
some drink  and when she had taken it  gave me such a patient smile  the
dear   so beautiful 

 daybreak had come  and the sun was rising  when she said to me  how
kind and considerate mr  copperfield had always been to her  and how
he had borne with her  and told her  when she doubted herself  that
a loving heart was better and stronger than wisdom  and that he was a
happy man in hers   peggotty  my dear   she said then   put me nearer to
you   for she was very weak   lay your good arm underneath my neck   she
said   and turn me to you  for your face is going far off  and i want it
to be near   i put it as she asked  and oh davy  the time had come when
my first parting words to you were true  when she was glad to lay her
poor head on her stupid cross old peggotty’s arm  and she died like a
child that had gone to sleep  


thus ended peggotty’s narration  from the moment of my knowing of the
death of my mother  the idea of her as she had been of late had vanished
from me  i remembered her  from that instant  only as the young mother
of my earliest impressions  who had been used to wind her bright curls
round and round her finger  and to dance with me at twilight in the
parlour  what peggotty had told me now  was so far from bringing me back
to the later period  that it rooted the earlier image in my mind  it may
be curious  but it is true  in her death she winged her way back to her
calm untroubled youth  and cancelled all the rest 

the mother who lay in the grave  was the mother of my infancy  the
little creature in her arms  was myself  as i had once been  hushed for
ever on her bosom
